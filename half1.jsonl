A few of Ayah are quoted as under: Allay Says;1. Jabir Bin Hayan (722-817 A.D): He was born in Iran. He worked in the field of chemistry but he also wrote a number of books on plants and animals. “Al-Nabatiat” and “Al-Haywan” are his two famous books on plants and animals, respectively. 2. Abdul Malik Asmai (741-828 A.D): He was great zoologist and wrote many books on animals like “Al-Kheil” on horse, “Al-Ibil” on camels, “Al-Shat” on sheep, “Al-Wahoosh” on wild animals and “Khalqul Insan” on the different parts of human body and their functions. 3. Bu Ali Sina (980-1037 A.D): He was greatest of all the Muslim scientists and considered as the founder of medicine. He is called as Avicenna in the west. He identified many diseases like tuberculosis, meningitis and other such inflammations. He also worked in the field of mathematics, astronomy, physics, paleontology and music.

The Species  is the smallest unit of taxonomic level of organization, which includes morphologically similar living organisms which inter-breed and produce fertile offspring.5. Population level: All the members of a species, living in specific habitat are called Population . A group of parrots living on tree, is called parrot population.6. Community level: The members of different species living in specific habitat are called as Community . A group of different kind of birds, living on tree, is called as bird community.7. Ecological system: Communities always depends upon their non-living environment in a reciprocal interaction for their survival. For example oxygen for respiration is obtained from environment and in turn given out CO. This 2interaction is called Ecosystem or Ecological system.8. Biosphere level: The part of earth where life exists is called biosphere. It consists of different kinds of eco systems.3. Cellular level of organization: The biomolecules when work together in the form of suspension, It is called Protoplasm . Protoplasm is the combination of organic and specific inorganic substances. When protoplasm work in the form of a unit, this is called Cell. Cell is the basic unit of living organisms. When similar type of cells organize together in a group, called tissues. The different types of tissues arranged in a particular manner to work together are called Organs . Organs of different types work in a co-ordinated manner to perform a function is called Organ-system . When different organ-system function in co-ordination in as a unit, they form a body or Multicellular Organism .8THE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION The levels of organization in living world are based on chemical foundation. All the living organisms are made up of cells and the protoplasm of cell is the physical as well as chemical basis of life. These levels are as follows:1. Atomic level of organization: All the matter is made up of elements, which is composed of atom (a: not, form: cut). Each atom is made up of sub-atomic particles, such as electrons, protons and neutrons. In nature, there are more than 100 kinds of elements and among these 16 elements are called as bio-elements, which are vital for life. Only six elements such as C, H, O, N, S and P are called basic elements of life. 2. Molecular level of organization: Molecules are formed by the binding of atoms. These organic molecules of cells are called as bio-molecules. These are constructed in great variety and complexity. They are classified as micro-molecules and macro-molecules. Glucose, amino acid and fatty acids are micro-molecules, where as  carbohydrates, proteins and lipids are macro-molecules. The units of micro-molecules combine together to form macro-molecules. 1.2Lions, Zebras,and theEnvironmentAtomMoleculeMacromoleculeCellTissueOrganOrgan SystemOrganismPopulationCommunityEcosystemEpithelialtissueLife on EarthLions andZebrasPanthera leo(Lion)BiosphereRespiratorySystemClara CellLungPride ofLionsPhospholipidDioxide  (O )2Oxygen   (O)INTRODUCTION TO BIOL OGYFig: 1.1 Levels of organization"}

The Species  is the smallest unit of taxonomic level of organization, which includes morphologically similar living organisms which inter-breed and produce fertile offspring.5. Population level: All the members of a species, living in specific habitat are called Population . A group of parrots living on tree, is called parrot population.6. Community level: The members of different species living in specific habitat are called as Community . A group of different kind of birds, living on tree, is called as bird community.7. Ecological system: Communities always depends upon their non-living environment in a reciprocal interaction for their survival. For example oxygen for respiration is obtained from environment and in turn given out CO. This 2interaction is called Ecosystem or Ecological system.8. Biosphere level: The part of earth where life exists is called biosphere. It consists of different kinds of eco systems.3. Cellular level of organization: The biomolecules when work together in the form of suspension, It is called Protoplasm . Protoplasm is the combination of organic and specific inorganic substances. When protoplasm work in the form of a unit, this is called Cell. Cell is the basic unit of living organisms. When similar type of cells organize together in a group, called tissues. The different types of tissues arranged in a particular manner to work together are called Organs .

Inductive reasoning  moves from specific to general e.g. Shark is a fish. All fishes have scales therefore sharks also have scales. Deductive reasoning  moves from general to specific. It is based on “if-then” statement. Deductive reasoning can be tested and verified by experiments. In malaria case, the following deduction is made: “If Plasmodium  is the cause of malaria, then all the malaria patient should have Plasmodium in their blood” as shown in figure 2.3.Experiment: Once a problem has been observed and a hypothesis is suggested, the next step in the scientic method is to design an experiment based on reasoning.

Plastids are the site of manufacture and storage of important chemical compounds used by the cell. Plastids often contain pigments used in photosynthesis, and the types of pigments present can change or determine the cell's colour. There are three different types of plastids:Chloroplasts:  Green-coloured plastids found in plants and algae.Chromoplasts: Contain red, orange or yellow pigments and are common in ripening fruit, flowers or autumn leaves.Leucoplasts: Colour less plastids.Centrioles:Figure 4.26 Centriole side view and pattern Animal cells contain a special organelle called a centriole. The centriole is a cylindrical tube-like structure that is composed of 27 microtubules arranged in a very particular pattern of triplets in rows. The site where two centrioles arranged perpendicular to each other are referred to as a centrosome. The centrosome plays a very important role in cell division. The centrioles are responsible for organizing the microtubules that position the chromosomes in the correct location during cell division.Triples of microtubules Centriole structureTriples microtubulesThe colour of plant owers such as an orchid is controlled by a specialized organelle in a cell known as the chromoplast.Golgi body consist of enzymes which modify the packaged products of the Golgi body. Proteins are transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to the Golgi. In the Golgi, proteins are modified and packaged into vesicle. The Golgi body therefore receives proteins made in one location in the cell and transfers these to another location within the cell where they are required. For this reason the Golgi body can be considered to be the 'post office' of the cell. Vesicles  are small, membrane-bound spherical sacs which facilitate the metabolism, transport and storage of molecules. Many vesicles are made in the Golgi body and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of the cell membrane. Vesicles can be classified according to their contents and function. Transport vesicles transport molecules within the cell. Lysosomes  are formed by the Golgi body and contain powerful digestive enzymes that can potentially digest the cell. These powerful enzymes can digest cell structures and food molecules such as carbohydrates and proteins. Lysosomes are abundant in animal cells that ingest food through food vacuoles. When a cell dies, the lysosome releases its enzymes and digests the cell.Vesicles and lysosomes:Vacuoles: Vacuoles are fluid-filled spaces that occur in the cytoplasm of plant cells, but are very small or completely absent in animal cells. Plant cells generally have one large vacuole that takes up most of the cell's volume in mature cell. A selectively permeable boundary called the tonoplast, surround the vacuole. The vacuole contains cell sap which is a liquid consisting of water, mineral salts, sugars and amino acids. The vacuole plays an important role in hydrolysis, excretion of cellular waste, storage of water, organic and inorganic substances.Figure 4.25 A vacuoleCELLS AND TISSUES"}

These reactions of an organism are collectively called metabolic reactions and this phenomenon of chemical activity called metabolism. The metabolic activities are always of two types, either constructive or destructive.  In constructive reactions large molecules are formed to form a structure of cell or body. These reactions are called anabolic reactions and this type of metabolism is called anabolism . On the contrary, the destructive reaction in which large molecules breakdown in small molecules to produce energy or to re-utilize further or to discard called catabolic reactions. The type of this metabolic activity is called catabolism . The chemical reaction requires particular conditions to carry down at proper rate, especially temperature and pressure. The conditions of temperature and pressure inside cell or organism are generally found not suitable for chemical reactions e.g. inside human body normal Otemperature remain 37C and pressure is 120/80 m.m of Hg. These conditions of temperature and pressure are not enough to perform any chemical reactions. Now question arises here how biochemical or metabolic reactions can occur without altering these conditions? Now body requires some facilitators. These facilitators helps to perform biochemical reactions at low energy. From above discussion it is clear now that each reaction requires some amount of minimum energy to initiate a reaction. This minimum amount of energy is called activation energy . If this amount is high the difficult will be the reaction or vice versa e.g. the activation energy needed to break a glucose molecule initially requires energy of 2 ATP molecules.  The high amount of activation energy cannot be provided by organism itself therefore they require some facilitators to reduce this activation energy. These facilitators are special molecules made up of mostly protein called enzymes  (En=inside, zyme = yeast). The name was coined due to observation when yeast was introduced in fruit sap which converted it into alcohol. Now the enzyme are defined as the biocatalyst which facilitate chemical reaction by lowering activation energy. This action of enzyme allows biological reaction to proceed rapidly at relatively low temperature and pressure tolerable by living organism.6.1DEFINITION ENZYMES 109BIOLOGY6.2CHARACTERISTICS OF ENZYMES Enzymes are biocatalyst, made up of mostly proteins and therefore  three dimensionally folded chains of amino acids with a specific shape. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids held together by bonds, for example Hydrogen bonds. Enzymes speed up reactions by bringing reactants together and reducing the activation energy required to start the reaction (enzymatic reaction) When an enzyme starts a chemical reaction, catalyzes the reaction hence does not utilized itself which means even a single or little amount of enzyme can start a reaction and catalyze fastly. Their presence does not affect the nature or properties of end products. Reactants of enzyme are called substrate. They are very specific in their action; a single enzyme catalyzes only a single chemical reaction or a group of related reactions. A small portion of enzyme where substrate attaches with enzyme is called active site. The shape of active site is complementary to shape of the substrate. They are sensitive to even a minor change in pH, temperature and substrate concentration. Some enzymes require cofactor for their functioning; a cofactor is a +2 +2non-protien substance which may be organic or inorganic. Zn, Mg, +2 +2 +2 +1 +1Mn, Fe, Cu, K and Na the organic cofactors are NADP, NAD and FAD are used in enzymes as cofactors.Cofactor can be categorized into prosthetic group (if organic cofactors are tightly bound to an enzyme) and Coenzymes (if organic cofactors are loosely attached with an enzyme) Activity of enzymes can be enhanced by activator and can be decreased by inhibitors. Many enzymes work in a sequential manner to produce a specific product. This pathway is called metabolic pathway. An enzyme inhibitor  is a molecule that binds to an enzyme  and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's  activity can kill a pathogen."}

Bioenergetics can also be defined as the study of energy relationships, energy transformation and transmission in living organisms.7.1.1 Chemical Process of Energy Transmission: In living organisms the energy is transferred through gain or loss of electrons during formation and breaking of chemical bonds. There are two chemical processes where it occurs, known with the name of oxidation and reduction. The oxidation reactions are those reactions in which loss of electron (e-) and proton occurs. These electrons carry energy from the molecules from where they release to the molecules where they added e.g. iron reacts with oxygen to form a chemical called rust, in this reaction iron (Fe) loses some e- which transfer to oxygen. In this reaction Fe is oxidized and it transfers its energy to oxygen through electrons. On the other hand, reaction occur called reduction, where gain of e- and H+ occur.

To carry out all the life process cells requires energy. The source of this energy is food or photo assimilates (Products of photosynthesis) in plants. Cells break food molecules to release their Chemical energy. The breakdown of food molecules to release energy is called respiration .7.3RESPIRATIONGlucose + Oxygen   Carbon dioxide + water + Energy CHO + 6O    6CO  + 6H O + ATP612 6 2 2 2 Usually cells use oxygen to oxide food. It results CO and water as 2waste products. The main food oxidized is the sugar i.e. Glucose. The overall equation for this chemical reaction is: Above equation shows that one molecule of glucose reacts with six molecules of oxygen to produce six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water. The main product is energy which is produced in the form of energy rich molecules called ATP. It is commonly believed that breathing and respiration processes are same but factually they are different, although they are linked. As we have discussed above respiration is the chemical reaction takes place in cells to release energy from food while the breathing is the movement of air in and out of the organism to supply O and CO. We use another term for 2 2breathing called Ventilation. Breathing allows the process of gaseous exchange at surface of cells and tissues. So the terms breathing, gaseous exchange and respiration are different from one another but linked together to make possible energy production at cellular level.BIOENERGETICS 129BIOLOGY7.3.1 Type of RespirationThere are two types of respiration found in living organisms for the production of energy. i) Anaerobic Respiration or Fermentation  ii)  Aerobic Respiration (i) Anaerobic Respiration: The primitive type of respiration which takes place in the absence of O 2or without O is called anaerobic respiration or fermentation. There are 2special conditions where Ois not available so the organisms adapt 2 themselves to break down their food without oxygen which is called anaerobic respiration or fermentation. It takes place in some bacteria, fungi, endoparasite and sometimes in animal. During anaerobic respiration, glucose is not broken down completely so less amount of energy (5 to 10% as compared to aerobic respiration) is released but it can sustain life even in the absence of O. It had evolved on 2earth where there was no O on earth. There are two types of anaerobic 2respiration.Alcoholic fermentation: The bacteria and fungi respire aerobically but when these organisms are deprived of oxygen they stop respiration aerobically and start respiring anaerobically instead, During this anaerobic respiration they produce ethyl alcohol with CO.2Acidic fermentation:  In animals when aerobic respiration is not enough to produced required energy they start anaerobic respiration. During this process glucose breaks down into a substance called lactic acid.Glucose   Ethanol + CO  + Some energy2CHO  2CHOH + 2CO  + Some ATP612 6 25 2 A limited amount of energy is produced as compared to aerobic respiration but this is enough to power the athlete's muscles during start time of sprint.

It results CO and water as 2waste products. The main food oxidized is the sugar i.e. Glucose. The overall equation for this chemical reaction is: Above equation shows that one molecule of glucose reacts with six molecules of oxygen to produce six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water. The main product is energy which is produced in the form of energy rich molecules called ATP. It is commonly believed that breathing and respiration processes are same but factually they are different, although they are linked. As we have discussed above respiration is the chemical reaction takes place in cells to release energy from food while the breathing is the movement of air in and out of the organism to supply O and CO. We use another term for 2 2breathing called Ventilation. Breathing allows the process of gaseous exchange at surface of cells and tissues. So the terms breathing, gaseous exchange and respiration are different from one another but linked together to make possible energy production at cellular level.BIOENERGETICS 129BIOLOGY7.3.1 Type of RespirationThere are two types of respiration found in living organisms for the production of energy. i) Anaerobic Respiration or Fermentation  ii)  Aerobic Respiration (i) Anaerobic Respiration: The primitive type of respiration which takes place in the absence of O 2or without O is called anaerobic respiration or fermentation. There are 2special conditions where Ois not available so the organisms adapt 2 themselves to break down their food without oxygen which is called anaerobic respiration or fermentation. It takes place in some bacteria, fungi, endoparasite and sometimes in animal. During anaerobic respiration, glucose is not broken down completely so less amount of energy (5 to 10% as compared to aerobic respiration) is released but it can sustain life even in the absence of O. It had evolved on 2earth where there was no O on earth. There are two types of anaerobic 2respiration.Alcoholic fermentation: The bacteria and fungi respire aerobically but when these organisms are deprived of oxygen they stop respiration aerobically and start respiring anaerobically instead, During this anaerobic respiration they produce ethyl alcohol with CO.2Acidic fermentation:  In animals when aerobic respiration is not enough to produced required energy they start anaerobic respiration. During this process glucose breaks down into a substance called lactic acid.Glucose   Ethanol + CO  + Some energy2CHO  2CHOH + 2CO  + Some ATP612 6 25 2 A limited amount of energy is produced as compared to aerobic respiration but this is enough to power the athlete's muscles during start time of sprint.

Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants, algae and some bacteria having chlorophyll, synthesize the simple sugar (glucose) from the simple raw materials i.e. water and carbon dioxide by using the energy of sunlight. Oxygen is released in this process. The overall equation of photosynthesis is:6CO  + 12H 02 2 CHO + 6H O + 6O612 6 2 2SunlightChlorophyll2. Heterotrophic nutrition: The word 'heterotroph' is derived from two Greek words-heteros (other) and trophe (nutrition). Unlike autotrophes, which manufacture their own food, heterotrophic organisms obtain food from other organisms. As heterotrophs depend on other organisms for their food, they are also called consumers. All animals, non-green plants like and fungi come under this category. Consumers which consume herbs and other plants are called herbivores, and those which consume animals are called carnivores. After taking complex organic materials as food, heterotrophs break them into simple molecules with the help of biological catalysts, i.e., enzymes and utilize them for their own metabolism. Depending upon the mode of living and the mode of intake of food, heterotrophs may be parasitic, saprotrophic or holozoic.1. Autotrophic nutrition: The term 'autotroph' is derived from two Greek words-autos (self) and trophe (nutrition). In autotrophic nutrition, an organism makes its own food from simple raw materials.Sunlightabsorbed byChlorophyllDiﬀusesthroughstomataReleasedinto the airFrom thesoil throughabsorption(ii) Saprotrophic nutrition:(Gr: Sapros=rotten, Trophic=nutrition) Saprotrophic organisms, or saprotrophes, derive their food from dead and decaying organic material. This mode of nutrition is called saprotrophic nutrition. They secrete enzymes that are released on food material outside their body. These enzymes break down complex food into simple forms. Common examples of saprotrophes are fungi (moulds, mushrooms, yeasts) and many bacteria.(iii) Holozoic nutrition: (Gr:Holo=Whole, Zoikos=of animal) In holozoic nutrition complex organic substances are ingested (taken in) without their being degraded or decomposed. After intake, such food is digested by enzymes produced within the organism. Digested food is absorbed into the body and the undigested product is egested (expelled out) from the body. This kind of nutrition is found mainly in non-parasitic animals-simple ones like Amoeba and complex ones like human beings.(i) Parasitic nutrition: Parasitic organisms, or parasites, live on or inside other living organisms, called hosts, and obtain their food from them. The host does not get any benefit from the parasite. This mode of nutrition is called parasitic nutrition. Different parasites, like Cuscuta (akash-bel), hookworms, tapeworms, leeches, etc., have different modes of feeding, depending upon habit, habitat and modifications.Cuscuta CassythaLeechTapewormFigure 8.3 Parasites"}

After intake, such food is digested by enzymes produced within the organism. Digested food is absorbed into the body and the undigested product is egested (expelled out) from the body. This kind of nutrition is found mainly in non-parasitic animals-simple ones like Amoeba and complex ones like human beings.(i) Parasitic nutrition: Parasitic organisms, or parasites, live on or inside other living organisms, called hosts, and obtain their food from them. The host does not get any benefit from the parasite. This mode of nutrition is called parasitic nutrition. Different parasites, like Cuscuta (akash-bel), hookworms, tapeworms, leeches, etc., have different modes of feeding, depending upon habit, habitat and modifications.Cuscuta CassythaLeechTapewormFigure 8.3 Parasites"}

The predominant symptom is interveinal chlorosis  (dark green veins with yellow areas between the veins). The bottom leaves are always affected first as shown in figure 8.5.Figure 8.5 Interveinal chlorosis8.1.2 Importance of fertilizers: Fertilizers are substances containing chemical elements such as manure or mixture of nitrates that improves the growth of plants. They give nutrition to the crops and produce more fruit, faster growth, more attractive flowers. When added to soil or water, plants can develop tolerance against pests like weeds, insects and diseases. And the use of manure and composts as fertilizers is probably almost as old as agriculture. Modern chemical fertilizers include one or more of the three elements that are most important in plant nutrition: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Chemicals fertilizers are simply plant nutrients applied to agricultural fields to supplement required elements found naturally in the soil. 8.1.3 Environmental hazards related to chemical fertilizers: An environmental hazard is a condition, which has the potential to threat natural environment or adversely affect people's health, including pollution and natural disasters. The farmers apply fertilizer for better growth of their crops, but on the other side these fertilizers pollute water and soil as well.1. Soil nutrient holding capacity: The massive quantities of inorganic fertilizers affect the soil nutrient holding capacity.2. Eutrophication: The high solubility of fertilizers also degrade ecosystem through eutrophication (means an increase in chemical nutrients typically compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus in an ecosystem). 3.  Emission of greenhouse gas: Storage and application of some nitrogen fertilizers may cause emission of greenhouse gas, e.g nitrous oxide.4. Soil acidity: Ammonia gas (NH) may be emitted from applied inorganic fertilizers. 3This extra ammonia can also increase soil acidity.5. Pest problems: Excessive nitrogen fertilizers can lead to pest problem by increasing their reproduction rate.NUTRITION"}

The malnutrition is a condition that occurs when a body does not get enough nutrients. Malnutrition results from a poor diet or a lack of food. It happens when the intake of nutrients or energy is too high, too low, or poorly balanced. Consuming less than 2100 calories a day, one is considered to be under-nourished and suffering from hunger. There are two types of malnutrition:  Chronic malnutrition:  characterized by delayed growth in the children.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malnutrition is the gravest single threat to global public health.

Acute malnutrition can be moderate or severe according to the child's weight. Under-nourishment and malnutrition have serious consequences for the health of the younger children. Worldwide, three nutrient deficiencies are of particular concern: Vitamin A deficiency is the world's most common cause of preventable child blindness and vision impairment. Iron deficiency is associated with decreased cognitive abilities and resistance to disease. Iodine deficiency is the major preventable cause of mental retardation worldwide.Malnutrition is one of the most prevalent public health problems in Pakistan. It is one of the major underlying factors for high infant and under 5 mortality rate in Pakistan. Poverty, lack of education, poor environmental hygiene and food fads are some of the reasons for its high prevalence in Pakistan.8.2.2 Protein deficiency disorders: Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) refers to inadequate availability or absorption of energy and proteins in the body. It is the leading cause of death in children in developing countries. PEM may lead to diseases such as; (a) Kwashiorkor: Kwashiorkor is a severe form of malnutrition, caused by a deficiency in dietary protein. The extreme lack of protein causes an osmotic imbalance in the gastro-intestinal system causing swelling of the gut diagnosed as an edema or retention of water as shown in figure 8.14.(b) Marasmus: Marasmus is a form of severe malnutrition characterized by energy deficiency.

Over intake of nutrients: It is a form of malnutrition in which more nutrients are taken than the amount required for normal growth, development and metabolism. The effects of over-intake of nutrients are usually intensified when there is reduction in daily physical activity (decline in energy expenditure). High intake of carbohydrates and fats leads to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Similarly, high dose of vitamin A causes loss of appetite and liver problems. Excess dose of vitamin D can lead to deposition of calcium in various tissues.8.2.3 Mineral deficiency disease: Diseases resulting from deficiency of a mineral are relatively rare among humans some are given below; 1. Goiter: Goiter is a condition in which thyroid gland becomes enlarged and it results in swelling in neck. Goiter is caused by an insufficient amount of “Iodine” in diet. Iodine is used by thyroid gland to produce hormones that control the body's normal functioning and growth.2. Anemia (most common of all mineral deficiency diseases): The term anemia literally means “a lack of blood”. The condition is caused when number of red blood cells reduced to a level lower than normal. Haemoglobin molecule contains four atom of iron. If body fails to receive sufficient amount of iron, an adequate number of haemoglobin will not be formed. So, there are not enough functioning red blood cells. A person becomes weak and there is shortage of oxygen supply to body's cells.Figure 8.15 (a) Goiter and (b) AnemiaNormallevel of redblood cellsAnemiclevelGoiter(visibility enlargedthyroid gland)(a)         Thyroid gland(b)Fatigue8.2.4 The Effects of Malnutrition Malnutrition hurts people both mentally and physically. The more malnourished a person is; the more nutrients the person is missing, the more likely person will experience health issues. Some of them are given below:1. Starvation: It is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake. It is the most extreme form of malnutrition. In humans, prolonged starvation can cause permanent organ damage and eventually, death.2. Heart diseases: The term \"heart disease\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"cardiovascular disease.\" Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Heart problems occur in those people who take unbalanced diet. Fatty foods increase blood cholesterol level. It obstructs the blood vessels leading to heart diseases. 3. Constipation: People do not schedule their meals. This irregularity cause many health problems like constipation. It can be well defined, a condition in which there is difficulty in emptying the bowels, usually associated with hardened faeces.4. Obesity: It is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. Obesity is known as mother-disease and may lead to heart problems, hypertension, diabetes etc.NUTRITION"}

Over intake of nutrients: It is a form of malnutrition in which more nutrients are taken than the amount required for normal growth, development and metabolism. The effects of over-intake of nutrients are usually intensified when there is reduction in daily physical activity (decline in energy expenditure). High intake of carbohydrates and fats leads to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Similarly, high dose of vitamin A causes loss of appetite and liver problems. Excess dose of vitamin D can lead to deposition of calcium in various tissues.8.2.3 Mineral deficiency disease: Diseases resulting from deficiency of a mineral are relatively rare among humans some are given below; 1. Goiter: Goiter is a condition in which thyroid gland becomes enlarged and it results in swelling in neck. Goiter is caused by an insufficient amount of “Iodine” in diet. Iodine is used by thyroid gland to produce hormones that control the body's normal functioning and growth.2. Anemia (most common of all mineral deficiency diseases): The term anemia literally means “a lack of blood”. The condition is caused when number of red blood cells reduced to a level lower than normal. Haemoglobin molecule contains four atom of iron. If body fails to receive sufficient amount of iron, an adequate number of haemoglobin will not be formed. So, there are not enough functioning red blood cells.

When we see, smell, taste, or even imagine a tasty snack, our three pairs of salivary glands, which are located under the tongue and near the lower jaw, begin producing saliva. This flow of saliva is co-ordinated with a brain reflex that triggered when we sense food or think about eating. In response to this sensory stimulation, the brain sends impulses through the nerves that control the salivary glands, telling them to prepare for a meal. Oral cavity is the space behind mouth in-between upper and lower jaw and has many important functions:Food Selection:  When food enters the oral cavity it is tasted and felt. Here food is selected or rejected due to the taste, hard object or dirt. Smell and vision also help in selection. Grinding of food: The second function of oral cavity is the grinding of food by teeth. It is known as chewing or mastication. It is useful because oesophagus can pass only small pieces through it as well as enzymes cannot act on large pieces of food. Lubrication of food: The third function of the oral cavity is lubrication of food by mixing saliva secreted by saliva. It has two main functions. (i) Adds water and mucus to the food. (ii) Partial digestion of starch by saliva which contains an enzyme salivary amylase.Chemical digestion:  Saliva contains an enzyme salivary amylase which helps in the digestion of starch partially. Than the pieces of food are rolled up by the tongue into small, slippery, spherical mass called bolus. Swallowing of the bolus: Swallowing is accomplished by muscle movements by the tongue and mouth, food moves into the throat, or pharynx. Functions of Pharynx and Oesophagus The pharynx, a passageway for food and air, is about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long. A flexible flap of tissue called the epiglottis reflexively closes over the windpipe when we swallow to prevent choking.

A person normally isn't aware of the movements of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine that take place as food passes through the digestive tract. At the end of the oesophagus, a muscular ring called a sphincter allows food to enter the stomach and then squeezes shut to keep food or fluid from flowing back up into the oesophagus. Functions of stomach:Stomach is j-shaped thick walled, expandable bag, located in the left of abdomen just beneath the diaphragm. The stomach has three regions: cardiac , just after the oesophagus, fundus , the largest part of stomach and pyloric , part located at the other end of stomach and opens into small intestine The stomach muscles churn and mix the food with acids and enzymes, breaking it into much smaller, digestible pieces. An acidic environment is needed for the digestion that takes place in the stomach. Glands in the stomach lining produce about 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of these digestive juices each day. When food enters into the stomach the gastric juice is secreted by gastric glands found in the stomach wall. It is composed of mucous, hydrochloric acid and protein digesting enzyme pepsinogen. Hydrochloric acid converts the inactive enzyme pepsinogen into active form called pepsin. HCI also kills micro-organisms present in food. Stomach is protected against the action of acid by mucus.

Pepsin partially digests the protein portion of the food into polypeptides and shorter peptide chains. In stomach food is further broken apart through a process called churning. The walls of stomach contract and relax and these movements help in mixing of the gastric juice and food. The churning action also produces heat which helps to melt the lipid contents of the food. By the time food is ready to leave the stomach, it has been processed into a thick paste like liquid called chyme. The pylorus keeps chyme in the stomach until it reaches the right consistency to pass into the small intestine. Chyme is then squirted down into the small intestine, where digestion of food continues.Functions of small intestine:The small intestine is made up of three parts:  The duodenum, about 25 cm (10 inches) long, C-shaped first part.

There are two processes of transport:(a) Passive transport:  The uptake of water and mineral by osmosis and  diffusion without using energy of ATP. It is due to concentration  gradient i.e. always takes place from high to low quantity of  substances.(b) Active transport:  Movement of substances from low quantity to  high quantity i.e. against the gradient and it requires energy of ATP.  This movement is called active transport.Fig: 9.2 Active transport1. Uptake of Water From Soil: The root hair is long, thin and tubular structure. It increases the surface area which increases the rate of absorption of water and minerals. The cell membrane prevents the cell sap (a mixture of sugar, salts and amino acids in solution form) from leaking out. The cell sap has low tendency of water loss i.e water potential, than the solution of soil which result in water movement from soil to root hair. This process of water movement from a solution of high water potential to a solution of low water potential is called Osmosis . As a result of osmosis of water, the root hair become turgid and their cell-sap become dilute than that of adjacent cells so the water moves from root hair to their neighbour cells. In this way, water may pass from cell to cell and finally forced into xylem and ascend up to the aerial part of plant. This upward movement of water with mineral is called ascent of sap, other factor and forces are also involved in ascent of sap. For absorption of water by root, it is necessary that the solute quantity in soil solution should be low and solute quantity in sap should be comparatively high, otherwise the direction of water movement will be reversed and plant may die due to dehydration.2. Mineral transport: Plant also require minerals i.e nitrates, sulphates, phosphates etc. These minerals are also taken up by root hair in two ways:(a) By diffusion, when the concentration of certain ions in soil is  higher than that in root hair cells i.e passive transport.Fig: 9.3 Diagram showing process of Osmosis and DiffusionOut sideIn sideSubstanceCarrier moleculeCellmembrane(a) Substance combine withcarrier molecule(b) Carrier transports substance acrossmembrane using energy from ATP (c) Substance released into cellTRANSPORT"}

{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "Biology", "page": 187, "text": "181BIOLOGY9.2.3 Significance of transpiration: Transpiration maintains low concentration of water and high concentration of solutes in cell i.e. high solute potential. The high solute potential of leaf cells attract more water and draw more water from xylem. This continuous withdrawl of water from xylem develops deficit of water in xylem which develops a pull or tension called transpiration pull. As a result of this transpiration pull and water attraction for other water molecule i.e cohesion of water, water is pulled upward in the xylem vessels through a continuous column called transpiration stream, which helps in ascent of sap.  By active transpiration, transpiration pull is created which helps  in the ascent of sap.180 The experiment shows that most of the water vapour is lost from the surface where stomata are present. Surface area of leaf is also an important factor for the rate of transpiration, because the larger size leaves have high number of stomata which increases the rate of transpiration. The desert plants require to save their water so they have smaller size leaves or their leaves become spines to reduce number of stomata as well as rate of transpiration.9.2.2 Stomata and its opening/closing mechanism: Stomata are the pores usually found in the leaf epidermis surrounded by two kidney shaped guard cells, these cells contain chloroplast while other epidermal cells do not. The guard cells control the opening and closing of stomata. The inner wall of guard cells is thick and inelastic whereas the outer wall is thin, elastic and permeable. The changes in the turgidity of guard cells controls the opening and closing of stomata. Stomata open when the guard cell become turgid and close when the guard cells become flacid. The turgidity of guard cell is regulated by concentration of solutes present in it which mainly depends upon the rate of photosynthesis. Opening and closing of stomata is one of the important factor to control rate of transpiration. The stomata remain open during the sunny day, as a result rate of transpiration increases. But at night they are closed, hence transpiration also stops.Fig: 9.5 Diagram showing opening and closing of stomaGuard cells Guard cellsNucleusvacuolevacuoleChloroplast ChloroplastEpidermal cellInner thick wallOuter thin wallClosed StomaOpened Stoma  Transpiration also increases the rate of absorption because the  loss at one end increases demand on other end.  Transpiration gets rid of the excess amount of water from plant.  Transpiration helps in mantaining the temperature of plant for  its metabolism and survival because evaporation causes cooling.  Opening and closing of stomata is also regulated by  transpiration, which indirectly influences upon the rate of  photosynthesis and respiration.

{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "Biology", "page": 188, "text": "181BIOLOGY9.2.3 Significance of transpiration: Transpiration maintains low concentration of water and high concentration of solutes in cell i.e. high solute potential. The high solute potential of leaf cells attract more water and draw more water from xylem. This continuous withdrawl of water from xylem develops deficit of water in xylem which develops a pull or tension called transpiration pull. As a result of this transpiration pull and water attraction for other water molecule i.e cohesion of water, water is pulled upward in the xylem vessels through a continuous column called transpiration stream, which helps in ascent of sap.  By active transpiration, transpiration pull is created which helps  in the ascent of sap.180 The experiment shows that most of the water vapour is lost from the surface where stomata are present. Surface area of leaf is also an important factor for the rate of transpiration, because the larger size leaves have high number of stomata which increases the rate of transpiration. The desert plants require to save their water so they have smaller size leaves or their leaves become spines to reduce number of stomata as well as rate of transpiration.9.2.2 Stomata and its opening/closing mechanism: Stomata are the pores usually found in the leaf epidermis surrounded by two kidney shaped guard cells, these cells contain chloroplast while other epidermal cells do not. The guard cells control the opening and closing of stomata. The inner wall of guard cells is thick and inelastic whereas the outer wall is thin, elastic and permeable. The changes in the turgidity of guard cells controls the opening and closing of stomata. Stomata open when the guard cell become turgid and close when the guard cells become flacid. The turgidity of guard cell is regulated by concentration of solutes present in it which mainly depends upon the rate of photosynthesis. Opening and closing of stomata is one of the important factor to control rate of transpiration. The stomata remain open during the sunny day, as a result rate of transpiration increases. But at night they are closed, hence transpiration also stops.Fig: 9.5 Diagram showing opening and closing of stomaGuard cells Guard cellsNucleusvacuolevacuoleChloroplast ChloroplastEpidermal cellInner thick wallOuter thin wallClosed StomaOpened Stoma  Transpiration also increases the rate of absorption because the  loss at one end increases demand on other end.  Transpiration gets rid of the excess amount of water from plant.  Transpiration helps in mantaining the temperature of plant for  its metabolism and survival because evaporation causes cooling.  Opening and closing of stomata is also regulated by  transpiration, which indirectly influences upon the rate of  photosynthesis and respiration. Every year number of plants die in hot summer day due to excessive loss of water from aerial parts which results in wilting and dehydration and ultimately may lead to death of plant in extreme conditions.

The right ventricle only pumps blood to the lungs while the left ventricle pumps blood to all other parts of the body. The resistance to blood flow through the body capillary networks is for higher than that through the lung capillaries so, a high pressure is developed in the systemic circulation, it requires a thicker muscle wall and narrow space.Fig 9.10: of Heart (internal and external L.S. of heart). The function of atria is to stretch to receive blood as it returns to the heart and then contract with enough force to push the blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. This requires a lower pressure than that developed in the ventricles, so the walls of the atria are much thinner and more elastic than those of the ventricles.AortaPulmonaryarteryPulmonaryveinLeftartriumMitralvalveAorticvalveLeft ventricle Right ventricleInferiorvena cavaTricuspidvalvePulmonaryvalveRightatriumPulmonaryveinSuperiorvena cava192right atrium and right ventricle are connected by Tricuspid Valve. Similarly, left atrium and left ventricle are connected by bicuspid valve. These valves prevent the backward ow of blood from the ventricles to the atria. Two main blood vessels are arising from ventricles to carry blood from heart to all parts of the body. The blood from the right ventricle is pumped through pulmonary arch to the lungs for oxygenation while the blood from the left ventricle is pumped through a systemic aorta to all the parts of the body. The pulmonary arch and systemic aorta, both are guarded by semi-lunar valves to prevent backward flow of blood. There is a difference in thickness of muscle wall of the left ventricle as compared to right ventricle.TRANSPORT The circulation of blood in our body is called double circuit system because it circulates blood in two separate circuits and enter twice in heart during complete circulation. These two circuits are:1. Pulmonary Circuit;  from heart to lungs and back from lungs to heart.2. Systemic Circuit;  from heart to different organs and from organs back to heart.1. Pulmonary circuit: It transports blood from right ventricle to lungs through pulmonary arteries and flow back to heart in left atrium through pulmonary veins. The deoxygenated blood from all over the body except lungs received in right atrium and then collected into right ventricle, upon contraction of ventricle this deoxygenated blood enters into pulmonary arch which supply this blood to the lungs, where blood gives up its CO and receives 2O from air at capillary level. The deoxygenated blood now becomes 2oxygenated which flow back to the left atrium through pulmonary veins. This oxygenated blood now circulates through the body by Systemic Circulation.2. Systemic circuit: Circulation of oxygenated blood from left ventricle through systemic aorta to all organs of body and back to heart by superior and inferior vena cava as deoxygenated blood is called systemic circulation or circuit. Upon contraction the left ventricle forces oxygenated blood into systemic aorta, the largest artery of our body. Initially, the aorta gives off three branches which supply blood to head, arms and shoulders. This aorta then descends down and gives off many branches which supply blood to their respective organs e.g. a branch which supplies blood to liver called Hepatic artery, another branch called renal artery supplies blood to the kidney and coronary artery to heart etc."}

The right ventricle only pumps blood to the lungs while the left ventricle pumps blood to all other parts of the body. The resistance to blood flow through the body capillary networks is for higher than that through the lung capillaries so, a high pressure is developed in the systemic circulation, it requires a thicker muscle wall and narrow space.Fig 9.10: of Heart (internal and external L.S. of heart). The function of atria is to stretch to receive blood as it returns to the heart and then contract with enough force to push the blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. This requires a lower pressure than that developed in the ventricles, so the walls of the atria are much thinner and more elastic than those of the ventricles.AortaPulmonaryarteryPulmonaryveinLeftartriumMitralvalveAorticvalveLeft ventricle Right ventricleInferiorvena cavaTricuspidvalvePulmonaryvalveRightatriumPulmonaryveinSuperiorvena cava192right atrium and right ventricle are connected by Tricuspid Valve. Similarly, left atrium and left ventricle are connected by bicuspid valve. These valves prevent the backward ow of blood from the ventricles to the atria. Two main blood vessels are arising from ventricles to carry blood from heart to all parts of the body. The blood from the right ventricle is pumped through pulmonary arch to the lungs for oxygenation while the blood from the left ventricle is pumped through a systemic aorta to all the parts of the body. The pulmonary arch and systemic aorta, both are guarded by semi-lunar valves to prevent backward flow of blood. There is a difference in thickness of muscle wall of the left ventricle as compared to right ventricle.TRANSPORT The circulation of blood in our body is called double circuit system because it circulates blood in two separate circuits and enter twice in heart during complete circulation. These two circuits are:1. Pulmonary Circuit;  from heart to lungs and back from lungs to heart.2. Systemic Circuit;  from heart to different organs and from organs back to heart.1. Pulmonary circuit: It transports blood from right ventricle to lungs through pulmonary arteries and flow back to heart in left atrium through pulmonary veins. The deoxygenated blood from all over the body except lungs received in right atrium and then collected into right ventricle, upon contraction of ventricle this deoxygenated blood enters into pulmonary arch which supply this blood to the lungs, where blood gives up its CO and receives 2O from air at capillary level. The deoxygenated blood now becomes 2oxygenated which flow back to the left atrium through pulmonary veins. This oxygenated blood now circulates through the body by Systemic Circulation.2. Systemic circuit: Circulation of oxygenated blood from left ventricle through systemic aorta to all organs of body and back to heart by superior and inferior vena cava as deoxygenated blood is called systemic circulation or circuit. Upon contraction the left ventricle forces oxygenated blood into systemic aorta, the largest artery of our body. Initially, the aorta gives off three branches which supply blood to head, arms and shoulders. This aorta then descends down and gives off many branches which supply blood to their respective organs e.g. a branch which supplies blood to liver called Hepatic artery, another branch called renal artery supplies blood to the kidney and coronary artery to heart etc."}

If the heartbeat is faster so as the pulse rate and if the heartbeat is slower, the pulse rate will be slower too. Taking a pulse is therefore a direct measure of heart rate. The second phase of pumping blood begins when the ventricles are full of blood. The electrical signals travel along a pathway of cells to the ventricles, this causes ventricles to contract. The relaxation of heart muscle and allowing the chambers to fill with blood, this phase of heartbeat is called diastole . The contraction of heart muscle and pumping the blood from the chambers into the arteries named as systole .Heart rate: The number of heartbeats in a minute i.e. the heart rate can be measured by the beating of heart. On average, a healthy heart beats 72 times in a minute. The normal range of heart rate is 60 – 100 beats in a minute. It is necessary to keep the heart rate within the normal range. The slow or fast heart rate may cause severe heart diseases. The heart rate may vary from person to person. The decreasing heart rate is a result of slow heartbeat, which leads to a condition called bradycardia. In this condition, the heart rate is too slow (or below 60 beats per minute) due to very slow heartbeat. This slow heart rate reduces amount of blood and oxygen to vital organs of body, and causes shortness of breath, dropping of blood pressure, extreme fatigue etc. On the other hand, when a heart beats very fast (more than 100 beats per minute), this condition is called tachycardia. Due to this rapid heart rate, the function of heart becomes very hard. It means that the heart does not have enough time to fill with blood and enough blood is pumped forward. The tachycardia is caused by the fever, dehydration, excessive caffeine or a reaction to medication. Chest pain, dizziness and fainting are the symptoms of tachycardia.Causes of tachycardia can be: Sudden cardiac arrest   Heart failure Weaken heart muscle   Lung diseases194Heart beat: The pumping of blood by the rhythmic pulsation of heart throughout the body is called heartbeat. It is a two phase pumping action of blood that takes less than a second. When blood is collected in the left and right atria, the heart receives an electrical signal that causes the atria to contract. This contraction pushes blood into the right and left ventricles through tricuspid and bicuspid valves respectively. TRANSPORT9.5.3 Blood vessels: The way large buildings have the corridors, similarly blood vessels run through all of the tissues of body, while some blood vessels are as wide as your thumb, most of them are much finer than a human hair. There are three types of blood vessels, which are;(i) Arteries,  (ii) Veins and (iii) Capillaries.(i) Arteries: Blood vessels carry oxygenated blood (except pulmonary artery) away from the heart. Right ventricle of heart pumps blood into the pulmonary artery that goes to the lungs. Left ventricle of heart pumps blood into the aorta (largest artery in body). Every organ receives blood from arteries that branch off the aorta. The first branch called the coronary artery, carry blood to the walls of heart itself. Other branches carry blood to the brain, intestine and other organs. Arteries wall consist of three layers, the inner most layer, which is made up of epithelial tissues. The middle layer consists mostly of smooth muscle and elastic fibers. The outer wall is made up of flexible connective tissue. Because of layered structure arteries have both strength and flexibility.(ii) Veins: Blood vessels carry deoxygenated blood (except pulmonary vein) from body towards the heart. The walls of veins, like those of arteries have three layers, with muscle in the middle layer. However, the walls of vein are generally thinner than those of arteries. They have large lumen. Blood pressure in the veins is much lower than the blood pressure in the arteries. Semilunar valves in the veins prevent backflow of blood. Flow of blood along the veins is assisted by the action of skeletal muscles on the veins."}

Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and mechanical engineer. He is known as Father of Computer because he developed the first complete computing machine. His first invention was Difference Engine. It was an automatic mechanical calculator. Difference Engine was a large machine, made of metal and was powered by steam. The Difference Engine had storage (mechanical memory) that could hold the data temporarily for processing and to store results. It was used to allow a user to enter calculations and get printed results. The Difference Engine worked on difference equations.Then, Charles Babbage designed but could not build a very big machine in 1837. This was named Analytical Engine. The proposed design included an ALU with basic programmatic flow control.  It was programmed using punched cards and contained integrated memory. Historians consider it to be the first design concept of a general-purpose computer because of its comprehensive design.(ii) Electro-Mechanical Era (Middle Age)th This era starts from the mid of 19 century. In this era scientists became able to develop faster and more accurate computing machines as they were powered by steam and electricity. One of such machines was Tabulating Machine.(a)  Herman Hollerith's Tabulating Machine (1890 A.D.) It was invented by American inventor Herman Hollerith in 1890.Hollerith's first tabulator was used for the U.S. 1890 Census. Because of Hollerith's tabulating machine census data took only six months to compile, which was very fast as compared to previous U.S. census in 1880 which took 7 years to be completed. Hollerith Tabulating Machine became very famous and used in many offices of U.S. Government.(iii) Electronic Era (Modern Age) The advancement in the vacuum or electron tube gave birth to the electronic era. In this era the true computers were invented which worked on the principle of input, store, process and output. Continuous advancement in electronic engineering increased efficiency and speed of computers considerably. The electronic era may be categorized in generations on the basis of core technology used to build computers.(a) First Generation of Computers (1940 to1956)  Based on vacuum tubes, first generation computers were very large in size. This generation computers used machine language (i.e. 1's and 0's).Magnetic drums were used as primary internal storage medium and punched cards for input. In this generation mainly batch processing operating system was used. Computers of this generation were primarily used for scientific and research purposes. Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC), Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) are examples of first generation computers.5 4Fig: 1.6 Babbage’s Difference Engine Fig: 1.7  Babbage’s Analytical EngineFig: 1.8 Tabulating MachineFig: 1.9 Vacuum Tubes"}

The microprocessor fetches, decodes, executes and stores all the instructions given by the user or any other device. The speed of computer mainly depends upon the speed of microprocessor. A microprocessor that has faster clock speed (measured in GHz) and more cores and cache works faster. There are typically five components of a microprocessor.(a) Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) ALU performs all the actual calculations like arithmetic operations and logical comparisons. Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division while logical comparisons include comparing, selecting and matching of data.(b) Control Unit (CU) Control Unit is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and instructions among other units of a computer. This unit controls the operations of all parts of the computer but does not carry out any actual data processing operations. CU functions just like a traffic policeman. It manages and coordinates all the units of the computer.(c) Clock Clock generates pulses and instructions are executed on the basis of pulses. Clock speed is measure in MHz and GHz.(d) Registers It is a temporary storage area that holds the data that is being processed. It is also known as programming model which may be of 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits or 64 bits. (e)  Cache Cache is an intermediate storage area, which is available inside microprocessor. The immediate processed information is stored in cache. The cache inside the microprocessor is called internal cache and outside is called external cache.(iii) Buses In computer, Buses are the electric paths on which data is sent and received by different components.

For many devices, operating system has drivers pre-installed in them. This gave rise to the concept of Plug and Play, where the device would be attached to the computer and the operating system will instantly recognize it. A non-plug-and-play device would require you to go through several steps of installing drivers and setting up the device before it would work.(iii) Utility Programs Utility means being useful. Utility programs are useful computer programs that help to manage, maintain and control computer resources. Operating systems usually have pre-installed programs that can serve the purpose, but utility software provides further functionality. One example of utility program is an antivirus software. This computer program helps to protect a computer from viruses and other harmful files. Hard Disk tools are also part of utility programs. They manage hard disk drives and other storage devices. This includes utilities to scan the hard disks for any potential problems. Disk cleaner utility is used to remove any unnecessary files while disk defragmenter is used to re-organize file on a hard disk drive to increase performance of disk.(iv) Language Translators Language Translators are used to translate human readable instructions into machine language. Computer can only understand machine language which is composed of 0's and 1's. The computer languages are used to make computer programs (software). Generally, software is written in high-level languages, using natural language words. Language translator are of three types; assembler, compiler and interpreter.(a)  Assembler: The assembler translates the program written in assembly language into machine language instructions for execution.(b)  Compiler: It translates the entire high-level language program at once into machine language before it is executed.(c)  Interpreter:  It translates the high-level language program line by line into machine language.1.5.2  Application Software Application Software is used to complete specific tasks, such as creating documents, databases, spreadsheets and presentations. Computer games, media players and web browsers are also the examples of application software. User needs to install application software to accomplish specific tasks. Application software are not pre-installed on operating system. They are installed separately. For example, making spreadsheet is not possible with Windows. For that application software such as MS Excel is used. There are different types of application software.  (i)  Productivity Software This kind of application software is used to produce things such as documents, spreadsheets, databases and presentations. Many of the productivity software are intended to be used in businesses and offices. MS Office for Windows is an example of productivity software.(ii)  Business Software Business Software are used to manage business activities efficiently. It is used to provide many business functions such as billing, database management and inventory management. (iii)  Entertainment Software This type of software provides amusement and fulfills a user's hobby. The most common entertainment software are video games. (iv)  Educational Software Educational software is used for teaching and learning. This kind of software is used in many schools to enhance knowledge of students in learning different subjects. Teachers are suggested to demonstrate how to configure/ install device drivers and use utility programs like Disk Defragmenter, Disk Cleaner etc.TeacherNote"}

For many devices, operating system has drivers pre-installed in them. This gave rise to the concept of Plug and Play, where the device would be attached to the computer and the operating system will instantly recognize it. A non-plug-and-play device would require you to go through several steps of installing drivers and setting up the device before it would work.(iii) Utility Programs Utility means being useful. Utility programs are useful computer programs that help to manage, maintain and control computer resources. Operating systems usually have pre-installed programs that can serve the purpose, but utility software provides further functionality. One example of utility program is an antivirus software. This computer program helps to protect a computer from viruses and other harmful files. Hard Disk tools are also part of utility programs. They manage hard disk drives and other storage devices. This includes utilities to scan the hard disks for any potential problems.

Process management manages creation, deletion, suspension and resumption of processes. The term process refers here to program code that has been loaded into a computer's memory for execution by the central processing unit (CPU). In a multiprogramming system, there will be a number of computing processes. The operating system must ensure that each process gets a fair share of the CPU's time. The OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor, and how much processing time each process should get. This function of OS is called process scheduling.

Multiple users can use specic computer at the same time in different places. A time sharing operating system is that in which from many tasks each task is given some time to execute so that all processes run smoothly without any problem. Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between them. As the system switches rapidly from one task or user to the other, a short time slot is given to each task or user for their executions and all feel that system is not shared. Thus, the user can receive an immediate response. For example, in a transaction processing, the processor executes each user program in a short time.These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different users also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.2.2.4 Real Time Processing Operating System (RT OS) A Real Time Processing Operating System is a time bound operating system which has xed time limit. Processing has to be done within the dened time limit otherwise system will be failed. Real Time Process System classied into two parts:Hard Real Time System:  A Hard Real Time System guarantees that critical tasks complete on time, even the shortest delay or urgency is not acceptable. Here system should meet the deadline. Missile systems and Air Trafc Control System are best examples of Hard Real Time System.Soft Real Time System:  In this time constraint is less strict. The meeting of deadline is not compulsory for each task, every time.  A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks until it completes. It does not guarantee that task will be completed in dened time but before a certain time and according to the priority. Online Transaction System, Airline Ticket Reservation in which reservation could be delayed but should be done after checking available seats and completed before aeroplane ight, etc. are the examples of Soft Real Time System.2.3 SOFTWARE INSTALLATION Software installation is the process of making programs ready for execution. Software installation or installer is a computer program that installs les, such as applications, drivers, or other software, onto a computer. Software is installed onto a computer by various means. They can be downloaded from the internet. They can also be installed from an installation CD or DVD or from a USB ash drive. 2.3.1 Installing Windows Operating System Operating system is the most essential software and there are many operating systems available. Windows is the most commonly used operating system which is developed by Microsoft. Choosing an operating system depends upon the hardware that we have. To maintain compatibility between hardware and software, the operating system vendor species the minimum hardware requirement. For installing Windows 10, we will need at least the following conguration. Apply and demonstrate the installation process of Windows OS and other software in a computer Apply installation process of any antivirus in a computer.SLOs2.3Fig: 2.7 Time Sharing Operating SystemUser 1User 2 User 3User 4User 5CPU"}

Online Transaction System, Airline Ticket Reservation in which reservation could be delayed but should be done after checking available seats and completed before aeroplane ight, etc. are the examples of Soft Real Time System.2.3 SOFTWARE INSTALLATION Software installation is the process of making programs ready for execution. Software installation or installer is a computer program that installs les, such as applications, drivers, or other software, onto a computer. Software is installed onto a computer by various means. They can be downloaded from the internet. They can also be installed from an installation CD or DVD or from a USB ash drive. 2.3.1 Installing Windows Operating System Operating system is the most essential software and there are many operating systems available. Windows is the most commonly used operating system which is developed by Microsoft. Choosing an operating system depends upon the hardware that we have. To maintain compatibility between hardware and software, the operating system vendor species the minimum hardware requirement. For installing Windows 10, we will need at least the following conguration. Apply and demonstrate the installation process of Windows OS and other software in a computer Apply installation process of any antivirus in a computer.SLOs2.3Fig: 2.7 Time Sharing Operating SystemUser 1User 2 User 3User 4User 5CPU"}

They can do so by adding languages from the Regional Settings of Windows Control Panel. Installation of these languages also installs their keyboard layouts and enables the ability to type text in those languages.3.1.2  Table of Contents (ToC) A Table of Contents (ToC) is an organized listing of the sections, groups and headings of content in a document and identied by page numbers where they are placed. It provides an overview of the document and allows readers to go directly to specic section or content in the document. ToC usually appears after the Title Page in a document. MS Word 2010 provides an advanced feature for automatically creating a ToC. A user can create an Automatic or a Manual table of contents in a document. To create a Table of Contents in MS Word document, go to the References Tab where Table of Contents button appears as the rst option of that tab. MS Word provides several options of creating a ToC that include Automatic Table creation, Manual Table creation or the user can even create a Customized Table of Contents based on the requirements of the document.(i) Automatic Table Automatic Table creates a Table of Contents automatically based on the content used as Heading presets of MS Word. Based on the type of Heading, Automatic Table of Contents will create the appropriate levels and show page numbers where those Headings are placed. The only difference between Automatic Table 1 and Automatic Table 2 is the title of the table that is “Contents” or “Table of Contents”.(ii)  Manual Table Choosing Manual Table from the Table of Contents menu will create a template of a generic table of contents. This table will need to be edited and dened manually by providing all the headings, sub-headings and page numbers. To extend the table, simply copy and paste the template lines and edit them to preserve proper formatting.3.1.3  Typing in Urdu and Sindhi Languages MS Word 2010 helps in writing letters, applications, CVs, question papers and books in default language set by Microsoft Windows (that is usually English). MS Word 2010 also supports typing text in various other languages like Urdu and Sindhi. To be able to write in other languages, the keyboards for those languages have to be installed in Microsoft Windows. MS Word also supports changing and setting its default language. To change the default language, go to the File menu and select Options. From the Word Options dialog box, select Language tab.

They can do so by adding languages from the Regional Settings of Windows Control Panel. Installation of these languages also installs their keyboard layouts and enables the ability to type text in those languages.3.1.2  Table of Contents (ToC) A Table of Contents (ToC) is an organized listing of the sections, groups and headings of content in a document and identied by page numbers where they are placed. It provides an overview of the document and allows readers to go directly to specic section or content in the document. ToC usually appears after the Title Page in a document. MS Word 2010 provides an advanced feature for automatically creating a ToC. A user can create an Automatic or a Manual table of contents in a document. To create a Table of Contents in MS Word document, go to the References Tab where Table of Contents button appears as the rst option of that tab. MS Word provides several options of creating a ToC that include Automatic Table creation, Manual Table creation or the user can even create a Customized Table of Contents based on the requirements of the document.(i) Automatic Table Automatic Table creates a Table of Contents automatically based on the content used as Heading presets of MS Word. Based on the type of Heading, Automatic Table of Contents will create the appropriate levels and show page numbers where those Headings are placed. The only difference between Automatic Table 1 and Automatic Table 2 is the title of the table that is “Contents” or “Table of Contents”.(ii)  Manual Table Choosing Manual Table from the Table of Contents menu will create a template of a generic table of contents. This table will need to be edited and dened manually by providing all the headings, sub-headings and page numbers. To extend the table, simply copy and paste the template lines and edit them to preserve proper formatting.3.1.3  Typing in Urdu and Sindhi Languages MS Word 2010 helps in writing letters, applications, CVs, question papers and books in default language set by Microsoft Windows (that is usually English). MS Word 2010 also supports typing text in various other languages like Urdu and Sindhi. To be able to write in other languages, the keyboards for those languages have to be installed in Microsoft Windows. MS Word also supports changing and setting its default language. To change the default language, go to the File menu and select Options. From the Word Options dialog box, select Language tab.

MS Excel has the ability to sort data according to the needs of the user. To help better understand this concept, take or create a list of products with their unit prices and quantities as shown below. The objective is to sort this list of products with prices and quantities, in alphabetical order based on the names of the products. To achieve this, rst select all the rows and columns which make up this product list then go to the Data tab and select the Sort option. In the Sort dialog box, choose Product from the Sort by dropdown list and make sure that in the Order dropdown list, A to Z is selected. Your data will be rearranged and sorted alphabetically based on the values in Product column and their respective prices and quantities will also be rearranged as sorted data as shown in the gure here. This data can also be sorted in terms of unit price and quantity.3.2.3 Formulas MS Excel 2010 allows its user to perform numerous calculations on  data. Common calculations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Comparison of two numbers and nding their average is also possible. Formulas tell MS Excel what calculation needs to be performed on the data. Formulas always start with an equal sign (=). They are dened in the Formula Bar. To understand this concept, take an example of two numbers, which are 220 and 87, placed in columns A2 and B2, respectively. The objective is to add these two numbers using MS Excel formula. To achieve this, follow these steps: 1. Select cell C2.2. Type = (equal sign).3. Select cell A2 in the worksheet by using the mouse or the keyboard. This action places the cell reference A2 in the formula of selected cell.4. Type +.5. Select cell B2 in the worksheet by using the mouse or the keyboard to put that cell's reference in the formula of selected cell.6. Press Enter.7. The answer (307) will be calculated by MS Excel and displayed in the selected cell (C2) where the addition formula was composed.

Each of them has its own characteristics like transmission speed, effect of noise, physical appearance, cost, etc. (i)  Twisted Pair Cable As name suggests, this cable is made by two separate wires twisted together. A twisted pair cable is made up of insulated copper wires. The insulation and twisting of wires prevent external interference. Each pair of wires has unique color code. This type of cable is widely used in different kinds of data and voice infrastructures.

Radio waves are omnidirectional and propagated in all directions. It means that sending and receiving antennas do not need to be aligned. FM, AM radios, television and cordless phones use radio waves for transmission.(ii)  Microwaves  Microwave transmission is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other. The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the height of the antenna. These are mostly used for mobile phone communications tower and television broadcast. Terrestrial and Satellite are two types of microwave transmissions.Terrestrial:  Terrestrial microwaves have both stations having antennas on earth. Satellite:  In satellite system (Figure 4.10), some antenna are on satellite in orbit and others are on stations on earth.

We can be a victim of computer crime at any time. Computer crime can range from an international data security threat to a personal offense. In 2013, hackers managed to hack 1 billion email accounts of the users. Likewise, in 2017, the WannaCry virus attacked the National Health Service in the United Kingdom which made the whole system non-functional for several days. As far as personal offenses are concerned, hacking the social media and mail accounts are so common. There are many genres of computer crime or now called cyber-crimes. Some examples of such crimes in real life are discussed here.(i)  Hacking Hacking is perhaps the most common crime in the computer world. Hackers can steal our WiFi, email or social media accounts' passwords. Hackers also attack a website and take it down. However, the scope of hacking is much wider. The hackers can also steal sensitive information from government and business organizations, make fraudulent transactions and erase data on the cloud or network computers.  (ii)  Credit and Debit Card Scam   Keeping debit or credit cards is a common practice but insecure use of these cards can be dangerous. If a person has information about our debit or credit card he or she can make fraudulent transactions. There are various ways to get this information. One way is through scamming. Scammers set small machines inside an ATM or credit card machine. These machines copy the data which is then misused by the scammers. Debit and credit cards are also secured with PIN codes. User has to keep this code secret otherwise any person can use the card for online shopping and other purposes. All he or she needs to know our credit card number, PIN and security code printed on the back of the cards.(iii)  Phishing Phishing is a method of trying to gather personal information using false e-mails and websites. In Phishing, perpetrators contact the target person through email, telephone or text message and pose as a legitimate and trusted individual. He or she asks the target to provide sensitive data such as personally identiable information, banking and credit card details and passwords for different reasons. The information is then used to access different accounts and can result in identity theft and nancial loss.(iv) Clickjacking Have you ever seen any video tagged as “OMG? You won't believe what this boy has done!” or did you nd a button on a website that asked to click to claim a reward you had never applied for? This is a kind of fraud which is called Clickjacking. Usually, culprits target children or novice internet users to click on a link containing malware or trick them into sharing private information via social media sites. (v)  Cyber Bullying or Harassment Electronic means like a computer, mobile phone or internet are also used for online bullying or harassment. Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, passing inappropriate remarks, leaking personal information, blackmailing and committing hate speech. The perpetrator does it with the intent to cause harm to the victim. Victims may experience lower self-esteem, intent to commit suicide and a variety of negative emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry and depressed.5.1.4 Cyber Attack Cyber-attacks occur when a cybercriminal uses computer or any device to launch attacks to other single or multiple computer networks. The culprit tries to enter in a computer system and network through cracking, scam links, phishing or any other method. Generally cyber-attacks are committed for getting any benet or causing harm to victim computer, network or websites. A cyber-attack either disables the targeted computer, deletes information or knocks it ofine. It may also steal information from the computer or network. 98 99"}

Viruses generally latch on a host le and when they execute they infect other les or programs. Boot Sector, Resident, Macro Viruses and File Infector are some examples of viruses.(ii)  Worm A computer worm spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction. It does not need to attach itself to a le or program to cause damage. It can do several malicious tasks, such as dropping other malware, copying itself onto devices physically attached to the affected system, deleting les, and consuming internal storage and memory resources.(iii)  Adware Adware is advertising-supported software. They present endless ads and pop-up windows that could potentially consume memory and processing resources. Adware can also change the different settings of internet browsers like homepage and default search engine. Normally, these are not as dangerous as other malware. However, Adware annoys the user and slows down the processing. The advertisements produced by adware are sometimes in the form of a pop-up or sometimes in little windows that may not be closed. Adware programs include games, desktop toolbars or utilities. Commonly, adware is web-based and collects web browser data to target advertisements, especially pop-ups.5.2Fig: 5.1 Cyber RescueHelpline "}

Spyware takes control over a mobile phone or computer without the user's knowledge. They capture information like web browsing history, e-mail messages, usernames and passwords and online payment information. Spyware can come through cookies or even when we install software without reading its terms and conditions. System monitors, cookies trackers, rootkits and key-loggers are few examples of Spyware.5.2.2 Ways of viruses spread A computer virus is just like a u virus. It is designed to spread from one device to another device and can replicate itself. Any device that is infected from a virus can infect other devices. It means that viruses come from outside. How do they come? Here are some ways:(i)  USB Flash Disk and CDs USB Flash Disks are the most common media to transfer les. An infected computer can spread a virus to a clean USB ash disk that is inserted and likewise, an infected USB can transmit the virus onto a clean computer. The AutoRun function in Windows OS launches installers and other programs automatically when a ash drive or CD is inserted. This action can initiate a virus spreading process onto the computer. Copying infected les from the USB or CD can also infect the computer.SLOsTeacherNoteTeacher should provide the information of viruses like Trojan horses, Rootkit, Backdoors, and Bots. This may be given as an assignment.  (ii) Internet Downloads Computer viruses also spread through les or software downloads from the Internet. They can be attached to software or les that we download. The viruses come from the internet can also make our computer accessible to hackers. Though, almost every antivirus software provides a shield against malicious downloads,it is highly recommended that the software and les must be downloaded from trusted sources.(iii)  Computer Network Users must be careful because les picked from a Local Area Network (LAN) may be infected and cause damage to our computer or operating system. The same can happen to transfer les from one mobile device to another mobile device via Bluetooth etc.(iv) Email Attachments Email attachments have been a popular medium to spread viruses. Viruses can easily be transferred from one computer to another through email attachments. The infected emails may come from an unknown or fake email address. Perpetrators who spread these viruses use either fake email or change a few letters in a trusted email address.

Spyware takes control over a mobile phone or computer without the user's knowledge. They capture information like web browsing history, e-mail messages, usernames and passwords and online payment information. Spyware can come through cookies or even when we install software without reading its terms and conditions. System monitors, cookies trackers, rootkits and key-loggers are few examples of Spyware.5.2.2 Ways of viruses spread A computer virus is just like a u virus. It is designed to spread from one device to another device and can replicate itself. Any device that is infected from a virus can infect other devices. It means that viruses come from outside. How do they come? Here are some ways:(i)  USB Flash Disk and CDs USB Flash Disks are the most common media to transfer les. An infected computer can spread a virus to a clean USB ash disk that is inserted and likewise, an infected USB can transmit the virus onto a clean computer. The AutoRun function in Windows OS launches installers and other programs automatically when a ash drive or CD is inserted. This action can initiate a virus spreading process onto the computer. Copying infected les from the USB or CD can also infect the computer.SLOsTeacherNoteTeacher should provide the information of viruses like Trojan horses, Rootkit, Backdoors, and Bots. This may be given as an assignment.  (ii) Internet Downloads Computer viruses also spread through les or software downloads from the Internet. They can be attached to software or les that we download. The viruses come from the internet can also make our computer accessible to hackers. Though, almost every antivirus software provides a shield against malicious downloads,it is highly recommended that the software and les must be downloaded from trusted sources.(iii)  Computer Network Users must be careful because les picked from a Local Area Network (LAN) may be infected and cause damage to our computer or operating system. The same can happen to transfer les from one mobile device to another mobile device via Bluetooth etc.(iv) Email Attachments Email attachments have been a popular medium to spread viruses. Viruses can easily be transferred from one computer to another through email attachments. The infected emails may come from an unknown or fake email address. Perpetrators who spread these viruses use either fake email or change a few letters in a trusted email address. People in our contact list may also send us infected les as they may not be aware of it themselves. Users must check the origin of the email before opening the attached les or clicking any link that is given in the email. Especially spam mails must be checked carefully before clicking on its attachment. 5.2.3 Antivirus   Antiviruses are utility software designed to protect computers from any potential threats of data or hardware loss.

This mainly offers the solutions which a at le system could not provide. The DBMS has many characteristics. Some of them are: Multiple users can access DBMS and can view, add, edit and delete records. A DBMS offers tools like Queries, Views and Forms which help users to manipulate data easily and more efciently. A DBMS is more secure and reliable.     DBMS allows distribution of data in multiple tables by making use of features like keys and relationships between elds of those tables. This allows lesser duplication of data and results in lesser redundancy. Preparing backups and providing limited permissions to the users are features of DBMS. DBMS can handle large and complex data more conveniently. Therefore, it is  preferred by the medium and large organizations.  BASIC COMPONENTS OF DBMS The basic components of DBMS are discussed below:(i)  Table It is a collection of data elements organized in shape of rows and columns. A contact list may be one of the simplest examples of a table. The marks record prepared by a class teacher is also an example of a table. (ii)  Field It is the smallest component in a database. It is where the actual data is stored during data entry. All data elds in the same table, have unique names. Fields are also called attributes or columns.  Multiple elds make up a data record, several data records make up a data table, and several data tables make up a database.(iii)  Record A single entry in a table is called a record. Records are also referred as tuples or rows. A record is made up of two or several data items which are also called tuples in a table representing a set of related data. For example, the illustrated Student table (Fig: 7.2) has 4 tuples /records/rows.(iv)  Data Types All elds in a table must have some data type. Data type is a data storage format that can contain a specic type or range of values. The data type of a eld is a property that tells what kind of data that eld can hold.Here are some basic data types.Different DBMSs offer different range of data types to be stored. For example, MS Access allows a range of whole numbers from -32768 to 32767 for an “Integer”. In modern DBMS, choosing proper data type is important to make sure that database runs faster. Fig: 7.2 Components of a TableDescription Examples Data TypeInteger Holds only whole numbers. 145, -35, 74586Floating PointHolds numbers with decimalpoints.5.6, 3.14, 554.9Character Stores only one character.

{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "Computer Science", "page": 157, "text": "151 1527.3.1  Entity In literal sense, an entity is any individual object which has its own qualities and properties. In database terms, an entity is an independent table and its elds are known as attributes. As an example, a Payroll database will contain an entity named Employees. The Employees entity will contain various attributes like EmployeeID, Name, Designation, Salary, etc.7.3.2  Relationship When the database structures grew and became more complex, a lot of data started to become redundant which means that data was being unnecessarily duplicated. This created a need to connect data entities instead of repeating same data in multiple tables. This resulted in the creation of relationships and Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). A relationship denes the connection between two tables. It creates a connection from an attribute of one entity with an attribute of another entity. Three types of relationships can be dened between entities.(i) One to One Relationship This type of relationship denes that a record in one entity can be connected to only one record in another entity. This is not a very common type of relationship because the data from related entities can directly be placed in a single entity. However, this type of relationship is used to divide larger entities into smaller ones.(ii)  One to Many Relationship This type of relationship denes that a record in one entity can be connected to many records in another entity. This is the most common type of relationship used in relational databases. This relationship can also be seen as Many to One Relationship .(iii)   Many to Many Relationship In this type of relationship, one or more records of one entity are connected to one or more records of another entity. Usually, a third entity known as “junction table” is used to create the many-to-many relationship between two related entities.7.3.3  Referential Keys The relationships are congured by using referential keys on entities. The keys determine a certain set of rules that must be followed by the data stored in a eld of an entity. In larger databases, keys are very important to uniquely identify a specic record. Two types of keys are most commonly used in RDBMSs:(i)  Primary Key A primary key is used to uniquely identify a record in an entity. When a primary key is applied to any attribute in an entity, it forces the rules of Primary Key onto that attribute. These rules are: The attribute (eld) must contain a unique value to identify a record. A unique value means that two records in the same entity cannot have the same value stored in this attribute where Primary Key is applied. The value of the attribute where Primary Key is applied, cannot be null.(ii)  Foreign Key A foreign key is used to dene the connection or relation between two entities. The foreign key of one entity is congured to be connected to the primary key of another entity. When a foreign key is applied on an attribute, it enforces that the value for that attribute should match any record in the related entity having a primary key.Understanding relationship and referential keys:The gure 7.3 shows four tables and their elds.Students  table is used to store personal information of individual student. It has an Id eld set as a Primary Key. It also has a ClassId eld to setup a One-to-One foreign key relationship with the Class table.Class  table is used to store information about classrooms in a school. It has an Id eld set as a Primary Key. A student can be enrolled in only one class; hence, Students table has a One-to-One relationship with Class table. However, many teachers can be associated with many classes. This requires a Many-to-Many relationship between Class and Teachers tables."}
