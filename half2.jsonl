{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_11": "MODEL TEST PAPER | (Units 1-4)  READING COMPREHENSION  Read the following passage and answer the questions below:  Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564, in the town of Pisa, Italy. He was the first of six children of Vincenzo Galilei, a famous music composer and lutenist, an expert at playing the lute, a musical instrument. Galileo also learned to play the lute. It was probably because he observed his father experimenting with music, to create new music, from an early age that he acquired this attraction for experimentation. Moreover, the importance of time and rhythm in music required calculation, hence, he acquired an understanding of mathematics and its relationship with everything.  As a young man, Galileo thought of becoming a priest, and then a mathematician, but his father wanted him to become a doctor because a doctor earned a higher income than a mathematician. So he enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. However, after attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine.  His interest in experimenting with different things started early. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed that a swinging chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. However, it was almost one hundred years later, that the swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece.  Because he needed to earn money, Galileo began experimenting with different things, trying to come up with some sort of invention that he could sell for money. He had a little bit of success with his invention that was like a compass and could be used to measure plots of land. By this time, he had already experimented with pendulums and magnets. He had also created a thermoscope, an earlier form of the thermometer, and in 1586 he published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance that he had invented.  102 "}
{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_12": "However, the invention for which Galileo is known is the telescope; the wonderful device that allows us to see from a distance. When he heard that a Dutch inventor had invented something called a spyglass, but was keeping it a secret, Galileo decided to work on one of his own. Within 24 hours, he had invented a telescope that could magnify things to make them appear ten times larger than real life.  His multiple interests included astronomy, the study of the universe and its contents. It was because of this interest that one night Galileo pointed his telescope toward the sky and made his first of many space observations. He noticed that the moon was not smooth, like everyone thought; it was covered in bumps and craters. As technology has improved, many others have made improvements on the telescope that Galileo first invented.  Galileo died on 8 January 1642, aged 77, after suffering from fever and heart palpitations.  Q.1.

Also, list down what steps should the people take to protect themselves from some of these problems.  Write these in your notebook in the format given below.  Reading Text  Health Problems Caused by Mosquitoes  Malaria, dengue, and chikungunya, all three diseases are spread by mosquitoes. The symptoms of all these diseases are so similar that it can be quite difficult to identify them for sure without laboratory testing. But it is important to find out what the exact disease is for it to be properly treated. Let us try and understand something about the causes, signs and symptoms, similarities and differences, and the prevention of these diseases.  Malaria Causes  Malaria is caused by plasmodium, a single-celled parasite, often transmitted by infected mosquitoes. It is injected into a person 2019s circulatory system through the saliva of the mosquito. "}
{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_20": "UNIT 5.1 READING COMPREHENSION  The parasite infects the red blood cells until they burst. Then, the newly developed plasmodium from the burst red blood cells spreads and infects more red blood cells throughout the body, thus killing all the cells. This can lead to severe liver infection. Sometimes the infected red blood cells become \"stickier\" than usual and clot easily, which can lead to stoppage of blood flow to the brain causing cerebral malaria.  Signs and symptoms  Malaria is recognised through high fever. The temperature may reach as high as 40  00b0C (104  00b0F). Fever is often accompanied by chills, and may also include sweating. Patients may also suffer from constipation, kidney dysfunction and disorientation.  Dengue Causes  There are four types of dengue viruses, all of which are spread by mosquitoes. An infected mosquito spreads the virus through its saliva when it bites. Dengue can also be transmitted from one human to another. For example, infected blood used in a blood transfusion can cause dengue. It can also be caused by organ donation and can even be transmitted from the mother to the child.  Once the virus enters the body it circulates around the body, attacking white blood cells and other antibodies, thus affecting the immune system. The virus further replicates within the cell until the cell bursts and dies. The death of the white blood cells results in leakage of other fluids from the cells, leading to low protein, fluid in the lungs and in the stomach area, low blood pressure, shock, and eventually death.  Signs and symptoms  High fever is followed by severe body pain. Pain behind the eyes and decreased urine output is also common. Dengue-related eye pain often increases with bright light. Patients may also feel respiratory difficulties and intense headache. As the fever decreases, skin rashes may start to appear.  Another symptom is excessive bleeding, as the virus attacks the capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body. When the capillaries burst, blood escapes  110 "}

The loss of blood can lead to decreased blood pressure, and may, eventually, lead to internal bleeding, shock, and death.  Chikungunya Causes  This virus is also transmitted through mosquitoes. These mosquitoes live and breed near stagnant or polluted water and infect humans with their bite. Although the disease is not contagious, it can spread from an infected person to others if the mosquito feeds on the infected person first and then bites other people.  The chikungunya virus infects the muscle cells of the body. It stays there and reproduces until the cell dies. It then finds a new host cell to infect.  Signs and symptoms  Chikungunya usually attacks the muscles, joints, skin, connective tissues, and even the central nervous system. It is usually accompanied by fever and skin rash. The skin rashes are almost identical to the dengue rashes. The patients may also suffer from headache, nausea and vomiting. Because the virus destroys cells in the muscles and joints, patients experience muscle weakness and joint pain, which can be severe. Partial loss of taste is also reported by many chikungunya patients.  The disease is rarely fatal and the virus remains in the system for 5-7 days. Once one recovers from this infection, one is immune to it for the rest of one 2019s life.  Similarities and Differences in the Signs and Symptoms of the Three Diseases  The chikungunya virus is transmitted by the same mosquitoes that spread the dengue virus. Both chikungunya and dengue have almost identical symptoms and disease processes; so much so that one can be mistaken for the other. Both display joint pain; however, joint pain and inflammation caused by "}

On the other hand, low platelet count, high bleeding risk, and pain behind the eyes are the main symptoms of dengue.  The main symptoms of malaria are chills/shivering, followed by fever/sweating. These symptoms usually occur every two days.  Prevention  Since there are no vaccines or medical ways to prevent these diseases, here are a few useful suggestions for protecting oneself from these diseases:  ** Wear clothes that will keep you fully covered  ** Use net coverings   00b0 Live in hygienic surroundings  *s Ensure that there is no stagnant water, whether clean or dirty, in your locality, not even in uncovered buckets, pots, cans or other things  ** Apply good quality mosquito repellent lotion or and any one of the natural repellent products  ** Take extra precaution from dawn to dusk   201c+ Seek medical help as soon as possible  All these diseases, that is, malaria, dengue and chikungunya affect a person 2019s  health.

Helen Keller  How fortunate are those who are born into this world with two eyes to see all its beauty! But there are some unfortunate people who can neither see nor hear. They cannot see the lovely flowers blooming in the gardens or hear the birds singing sweet songs. But, worse is the fate of those who could see and hear once, and then no more. However, many of them are courageous and bold! They accept the challenge of their fate and try to live life cheerfully. One such brave and courageous person was Helen Keller.  Helen Keller was born in 1880 in a little town of the United States of America. Up to the age of two, she was quite a normal child; she could see and hear everything. In February 1882, little Helen fell seriously ill and became blind and deaf. Her parents were very sad, but they never gave up; they never lost hope.  When Helen was seven years old, her life changed completely. Her father heard about Miss Sullivan, a woman who had become blind at one time but she was one of those lucky few who regained their sight. This woman chose to thank God for His kindness by helping other blind people and bringing hope and happiness in their lives. Helen 2019s father approached her and asked her to come and look after his blind child. Miss Sullivan agreed and started teaching Helen.

Helen felt excited because she knew that at last there would be some light in her dark world. The work was very slow and difficult, but Miss Sullivan was very kind and patient. Little by little, she taught Helen about mountains and rivers and about history and geography. She even taught her how to count and do sums.  When Helen was eight, she was sent to school for blind children. Although Helen was blind and deaf, she could speak. But, she had forgotten how to speak. Her teacher was aware that often people who could not hear did not speak because we speak the words and language that we hear. So, she started helping her to regain her speech. She would put Helen 2019s hand on her own lips and let her feel the movements of the lips at the time of speaking. Helen did many exercises of this kind and finally, at the age of ten, she was able to speak again.  201cWhat a joy! 201d she exclaimed.  By and by, she learnt to read books. These books were printed in a special language developed for blind persons, called  201cBraille 201d. The words were written with raised points instead of being printed and she read them by touching them with her fingers. In this way, she was able to read as much as other people could. She passed all her examinations easily. She went to college, and then to the Harvard University. She graduated from the university without difficulty. In fact, she proved to be a better student than many others. Her teachers loved and admired her.  In 1956, Helen Keller visited Pakistan. She was seventy-six but still very active. She came to Pakistan to see how she could help other deaf and blind people. She addressed many gatherings and encouraged those with similar short comings. She also visited the school for the deaf, dumb and blind, in Karachi. Addressing the students, she said,  201cHow wonderful it is to be with you my sons and daughiers! Always be happy and cheerful. Never curse your fate. You can do everything in this world. 201d She also praised the volunteers, who were working and teaching there with so much zeal and self-less dedication. "}

He thought if he could find out the answers to three questions, he would discover the secret and never fail. He thought and thought for many days but the answers evaded him. So, he called all his ministers and asked them these three questions:  1. What is the most important time to start something? 2. What is the most important work to do? 3. Who is the most important person?  But, none of them could come up with a satisfactory answer.  Next, he called all his courtiers and asked them the same questions. They discussed and debated for long but none of their answers satisfied the king.  He then called the wise and learned men of his country to his court. He discussed the problem with them for many days. They too were unable to satisfy the king, because they could not see eye to eye with each other, and ended up arguing amongst themselves. They came up with many different answers but none of the answers provided any meaningful solution.  The king then asked his ministers to announce that whoever answers these questions, would get a reward of 5000 gold coins. Many people came and talked to the king but their answers did not satisfy the king.  At some distance from the capital, there was a jungle. The king had heard that in the jungle there lived an old wise man who was considered a saint. He lived all alone. His fame had spread far and wide as someone who would solve everyone 2019s problem. The king decided to consult the wise old saint. But the problem was he only mixed with the poor and needy. He did not mix with the rich and wealthy. Since the saint did not like meeting wealthy people, the king started thinking as how to approach him. "}
{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_75": "UNIT 7.1 READING COMPREHENSION  The king pondered and thought deeply about a way to meet the saint. Soon he came up with a plan. He dressed himself in rags and set out to see the wise old saint. Since he wanted to appear poor and destitute, he asked his servants to remain behind. Alone, he headed straight for the saint 2019s hut.  When the king arrived at the hut, the saint was digging the ground in front of his hut. He was old and weak, and as he worked he was breathing hard. He tired quickly and stopped frequently to rest. The king approached him and addressed him directly.  201cSir, | have come a long way to ask you the answers to three important questions. 201d The king continued,  201cMy first question is: What is the most important time to start some work? My second question is what is the most important work to do? And third, who is the most important person? 201d Humbly the king continued,  201cWould you kindly help me by telling the answers to these questions? 201d  The saint paid no attention to the king and continued digging. The king waited for a few moments and then said,  201cSir, you look tired. Let me dig the ground for you. 201d  The saint thanked him and gave him the spade, and the king started digging. After some time the king repeated the questions and requested the answers. But all that the saint said to the king was,  201cLet me dig now. 201d The king did not give him the spade, and kept digging. He remained calm and did not lose patience. The hope that he would find the answers to his questions, kept him motivated and determined. When evening fell and the light began to fade, he stopped digging and turned to the saint. He said,  201cCould you please let me have the answers to my questions now? 201d  The saint remained silent and pointed to one side. The king glanced in that direction and saw that a bearded man with a dagger in his hand was running towards them. When he reached them, he fell down and fainted. The king straightaway picked up the bearded stranger and carried him into the hut and laid him down on the ground. The king noticed that the man was injured, so he immediately took steps to stop the bleeding and, with the help of the saint, he bandaged his wounds. The bearded man fell into a deep restful sleep.

My grandparents and two of my unmarried aunts lived in one room, we, my parents and siblings, lived in another room, while my uncle and his family lived in the third room. We had a common kitchen, where the women of the family cooked for all of us.  The house in which | now live is made of cement and painted in beautiful colours, with tiled floors; however, the houses in our village were all made of wood, straw and mud. We had no furniture, as such; we sat on the floor and slept on the floor by spreading some quilts that were kept on a wooden stand during the day. This was probably why very few people had knee problems; people of all ages comfortably sat on the floor, which exercised their knees.  Our village did not have roads or streets; there were just narrow mud lanes, which became very slippery during the rainy season. Commuting from one place to another was not an issue; people did not need cars, buses or even motorbikes to go from one place to another in the village, they just walked.

Floods everywhere! The much needed rain is here. While water in an important need of life, too much of it can cause flooding and devastation. In Pakistan, floods create havoc when rivers over flow their banks during the monsoon season.  Rivers have always played a very important role in the life of human beings. They have served as trade routes from the earliest of times. Before the building of roads and railways, most trade was carried on by boats and ships along rivers. In addition to this, rivers have been important for growing food. This was the reason that most towns in ancient times were built near rivers.  However, rivers flood during the rainy season and run dry or have very little water sometime after the rains. One way that people have found to capture and retain the rain water for later use is by building structures to hold the water and prevent it from flooding. This way, the retained water can be used throughout the year for growing food. One way in which water is stored is through barrages built on rivers.  A barrage is a kind of wall, which blocks the flow of water. It has gates, through which the water is allowed to pass in a limited quantity. Its aim is to control the flow of water in the flood season, store it, and release it for irrigation, through the canals, throughout the year.  The Guddu barrage, built on the river Indus, is one of the many barrages built in Pakistan. It is built at a place where the river is fourteen kilometres in width. It is designed to force the water, spread over fourteen kilometres, to pass through a narrow barrage, about one kilometre wide. The barrage is 1355 kilometres in length. It is made in such a way that a flood of about 1.2 million cusecs can pass through it.  The Guddu barrage has a system of three main canals. Two of these are on the right bank and one on the left. The Begari Sindh Feeder and the Desert Pat Feeder, are on the right bank. The third canal, the Ghotki Feeder is on    "}
{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_99": "UNIT 8.1 READING COMPREHENSION  the left bank. The three canals are amongst the largest feeder canals in the world. The barrage is meant to irrigate an area of 2.7 million acres. Most of this area lies in the Sukkur and Jacobabad districts of Sindh, and the rest in the Kalat division of the Baluchistan province.  The Guddu barrage is one of the biggest barrages of Pakistan. It has also been the most difficult to complete. More than 5000 engineers, technicians, and labourers worked day and night to complete it. It was put into operation on 4\" February, 1962.    =| The barrage has tamed  _ the river and put an end  to the damage caused by  floods in this area. It is  about time that the government _ started constructing more  barrages to control   2014 flooding during the rainy  : season and to supply   2014 water throughout the year  for irrigating more land so  that Pakistan becomes self-sufficient in meeting its demands for grains,  fruits and vegetables.

Like adjectives, adverbs also have three degrees, positive, comparative and superlative. One syllable adverbs usually take -er to form the comparative degree and -est to form the superlative degree (e.g. high  2014 higher  2014 highest).  The adverbs that have two or more syllables usually form the comparative degree with  2018more 2019 and the superlative degree with  2018most 2019 (e.g. smoothly  2014 more smoothly  2014 most smoothly).  Adverbs can have irregular degrees also (e.g. badly  2014 worse  2014 worst)  Exercise 1  Complete the following table by adding the missing degree of adverbs.

Along with wheat and corn, it is one of the three crops on which human beings largely depend as food for survival. Rice is now one of the most important crops at the global level, as it is used as a staple food in most countries of the world and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. In the coming 30 years, the world will require 70% more rice than that it requires today.  Pakistan is the world's 4th largest producer of rice. Each year, it produces an average of 6 million tonnes and together with the rest of the South Asia, the country supplies 30% of the world's rice. Rice is Pakistan's third largest crop in terms of area sown, after wheat and cotton. About 11 percent of Pakistan's total agricultural area is rice during the summer or \"Kharif\" season.  Most of the rice is grown in the fertile Sindh and Punjab region, with millions of farmers relying on rice cultivation as their major source of employment. Both provinces account for about 87 percent of the total rice production. Punjab is the biggest producer of rice in the country and contributes 58 per cent to the national production, while the provinces of Sindh, Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPk) contribute 29, 3 and 10 per cent, respectively.  The major rice producing areas in Punjab include Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Wazirabad, Gujrat, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Kasur,Jhang, and Okara. In Sindh, Jacobabad, Larkana, Badin, Thatta, Shikarpur, and Dadu are important rice cultivation areas. District Nasirabad in Baluchistan and some parts of KPK also have rice producing areas.

It was a family ritual to gather at his grandparents' house every Sunday and on public holidays. Karim really looked forward to the large gatherings when the house was brimming with young and old, 20 of them in all including his father and two uncles, their wives, Karim's aunty and uncle, and 10 cousins. He enjoyed listening to the conversations especially those led by his Dada while he would be sipping tea or munching on dried apricots, depending on the weather.

On one such Sundays they were taking their usual seating spots, Karim 2019s younger cousin, Zainab excitedly asked to raise the volume of TV. Karim turned around to see what was coming on TV that made Zainab so excited, and found that it was a soap ad showing germs as monsters being fought by the soap. Karim laughed out loud and said,  201cZainab, it is not real  2014 they just want to sell their products. Make money. It is of no  use.  Zainab, who was studying in Grade 2, looked at Karim with a perplexed expression, as if deciding whether to stay quiet or speak up. After a moment or two, she mustered her courage and decided to speak her mind  Zainab: \"Bhaiya, they came to our school told us how handwashing is extremely necessary to protect us. My teacher also showed us how to wash hands properly and the critical times when we must wash both our hands.\"  Karim laughed again and told Zainab she was being fooled. He added convincingly,  \"Believe me, just washing hands cannot protect anything or anyone in an environment full of germs and bacteria.Pollution is everywhere. 201d  Zainab now had a painful expression on her face, almost woefully she said,  201cBut it does Bhaiya.

Her mother told her a day before that they would be attending her aunt's wedding in Karachi in the last week of December. She was excited to finally step out of her village in Shikarpur and go to the biggest city of Sindh,Karachi, famous for its lights, cityscapes and sea. Up until then, Abeera's exposure to Karachi was through TV dramas and advertisements, the prospect of travelling there filled her with positive anticipation. On the last day of school, she excitedly told her Class teacher, Ms. Seema, about her trip to Karachi. Ms. Seema smiled looking at her excitement and told her that she must share her travel experience with the whole class when she returns to Shikarpur  Abeera's time in the city passed by in a frenzy of activities. The wedding festivities, songs and dance, chatter and playing with her cousins, and abundance of food. Almost every day, she ate a meal which was cooked outside or all the young cousins went out to eat. Despite enjoying the company and wanting to have more fun, Abeera could not eat outside food anymore as she felt very sick and nauseous. She could hardly bear to see more oily, spicy and fried food. She was now yearning to go back to her home, sleep properly and eat home-cooked food. Come January, Abeera's travelled back to the village and Abeera got her heart's desire.  On her first day back at school, Ms. Seema asked her about the Karachi visit. Abeera literally burst out and complained about how she couldnot fully enjoy the experience because of her health. After listening to her account, Ms. Seema looked at her thoughtfully, and asked other students what in their view made Abeera feel sick.  Zain replied, \"Teacher, it must be oil and spice.\"  Aisha added, \"she ate food which was not home cooked.\"  Raheem also raised his hand and said, \"Areeba's stomach got tired, she ate more food than what her normal diet was.\"  Ms. Seema smiled and said they pointed out at the right factors. She added that human body not only needs balanced diet but also a proper routine to function.

A desert is a vast plain of sands and stones, having some mountains and hills of various sizes and heights. They are usually without roads or shelters. Sometimes, deserts have springs of water, which create green, grassy spots, with a few trees. One of the most remarkable deserts of the world is the Sahara Desert.  Springs of water are usually few and far apart in deserts. Where such springs are there, an oasis is formed. An oasis is an area in the desert where there is water and where plants grow. It is a place where tired travellers and their animals quench their thirst and find a shady place to rest. Were it not for these small springs and shady places, no human being could cross the vast stretch of burning sand. To be thirsty in a desert, without water, exposed to the burning sun without shelter, is one of the greatest sufferings that a human being can be exposed to.  One of the most remarkable deserts in the world is the Sahara Desert. This desert is a vast plain, but is slightly above the sea level. It is covered with sand and gravel, with a mixture of sea shells, and looks like the basin of an evaporated sea. Amid the desert, there are springs of water and oases. There are thirty-two of these that contain fountains and date palms; twenty of them are inhabited. They serve as stopping places for the caravans.    "}

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for young adolescents. It replenishes energy quota in the body which is used up during sleep. Therefore, it must always be balanced with all the food groups present in it.  2.

Reading text Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai  Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, who is lovingly called Lal Latif by his devotees, was a noted Sindhi Sufi scholar, mystic, saint, and poet. He is considered as the greatest Muslim poet of the Sindhi language. Information about the life of Bhitai has mostly been collected from oral traditions. A renowned Pakistani scholar, educationist, and writer of plays, dramas and stories, Mirza Kalich Beg, is said to have collected details about the early life of Shah Bhitai from some of the old people living at that time. These people had heard these facts from their fathers and grandfathers, some of whom had seen Shah Latif in person and had even spoken to him.  As a Sufi poet, Latif 2019s  2018Urs 2019 is held at his shrine every year, on 14\"\" Safar, the second month of the Muslim calendar. Thousands of people gather and listen to the saint 2019s songs sung on the  2018Tambooro 2019. Many learned men read papers that tell about Latif 2019s life and his poetry. Some of the key aspects shared by different scholars about Lal Latif are given below:    "}
{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_155": "UNIT 2.1 READING COMPREHENSION  3. Early Life and Education     4, Youth    Shah Bhitai was born in 1689 A.D / 14th Safar 1102 A.H., in a small village called  2018Hala Haveli 2019, a few miles to the east of the present town of Bhit Shah. Latif was raised during the golden age of Sindhi culture. His first teacher was Akhund Noor Muhammad _ Bhatti, but mainly he was self-educated.  Young Latif had a very sensitive mind. While he was only a boy, he started composing poetry. His admiration for the beauty of nature filled his heart with the love of God. In 1713 the Sufi poet married with Bibi Saidha Begum. His wife died at an early age, before she could have any children. However, Shah never married again. His heart turned more and more towards religion and devotion and he felt restless; he found it difficult to live a normal domestic life.  Although he received little formal education, the Risalo provides proof that he knew Arabic and Persian quite well. Various references in Shah Jo Risalo indicate that he had in-depth knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and the Hadiths. His poetic collections included the Masnavi of Moulana Jalaluddin Rumi and Shah Karim 2019s poems.    "}

He was buried on the same mound. It is said that one day he ordered the musicians to play music. They played continuously for three days. When they stopped playing, they found the poet dead. A famous king of Sindh, Ghulam Shah Kalhoro, was so devoted to him that he built a grand mausoleum over his grave. The lovely white dome of the shrine represents the purity and dignity of Latif.  His devotees collected his poetry and this collection is called the  201cRisalo of Shah Abdul Latif. 201d Every year the devotees celebrate his Urs, which commences on 14\" Safar and lasts for three days.

He was a Sufi in the true sense of the word. The word 'latif' literally means fine, delicate, tender, elegant, and light. This meaning is truly reflected in both his poetry and his personality. Moreover, he was a poet of the people, so he wrote in the language of the common man. In his poems he writes mainly about Sindh and its neighbouring regions. However, he also mentions distant cities, such as Istanbul and Samargand, and also talks about Sindhi sailors (Samundi), their navigation techniques, and their voyages as far as the Malabar coast, Sri Lanka and the island of Java. Here is the translation of one such verse:  Clouds return and once again, it rains. Lightning flashes from all sides, and with it, some go to Istanbul, others turn to the west. Some shine bright over China and others take care of Samarqand. Some wander to Rome, to Kabul and Kandahar, some lie on Delhi, Deccan, thundering over... My beloved Allah, may you always make Sindh, a land of abundance, my beloved Allah, may you make prosperous the whole universe. (Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, Sur Sarang, Shah Jo Risalo).  His collected poems have been compiled in Shah Jo Risalo, which has been translated into English, Urdu, and other languages. His spiritual and mystic poetry carries a message of love, which makes it universal and acceptable to the entire human race.

Tanveer ran far ahead, to the end of the town and further, because he wanted the prize. Junaid, on the other hand, walked until midday and turned around to return home. When Tanveer felt that he had run far enough and Junaid would never be able to catch up with him, he turned around to return home. Unfortunately, because he had been running so fast, Tanveer was very tired, so the return was slower. When he finally returned home, long after sunset, he found that Junaid was already home.  Tanveer demanded his prize for running very far but his father pointed out that he hadn't returned within the time he was supposed to be back, therefore, the prize would be given to Junaid because he had completed the task according to instructions.

Read the following passage and underline the main ideas/ words in each paragraph; do not include any details. The first paragraph has been done as an example.  Moen-jo-Daro or the  2018Mound of the Dead 2019 is one of the oldest cities in the world. Few people live there today, but 4,500 years ago, it was a large, busy city. It is in the province of Sindh, at a distance of 27 kilometres from Larkana, on the right bank of the Indus River. It was one of the early urban settlements in the world. The city was built around 2600 BC. It was one of the largest city- settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia. The Indus Valley Civilization developed around 3000 BC, from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India.  Nobody knew anything about Moen-jo-Daro until 1922, when some villagers found pieces of old smooth pots and old bricks at the place where the city was discovered. These pieces of old pots and bricks were brought to Sir John Marshall, an English civil servant, whose work it was to look after historical remains. When he looked at them, he at once knew that they were pieces of very old pots. He decided that the area should be dug up as there might be remains of an old city.  So, the men started digging and as they dug, more and more such pieces came up, till there appeared, bit by bit, a city of straight roads, and well-built houses. When the people saw all this coming up, from what they had so far taken to be only mounds of clay and sand, they were very surprised and excited. Each house was made of large baked bricks and had a bathroom and servant quarters closed by. Covered drains ran beside the streets. Even the streets were made of baked bricks. There was a wide road in the middle of which had shops on both sides. This road continued on to the houses of the workmen. "}

Clay dolls and carts were made for the children to play with.  For a long time, these people lived a happy life. They were quite rich and travelled from place to place on business or for pleasure. Their city was well- planned and clean. The rain water did not remain on the streets. We do not know what happened to them.

Each type is used for a specific purpose. Below are two sentence types and the purpose for which each type is used.  1. Declarative Sentences are sentences that are generally called statements. They can be affirmative or negative.  For example: o I 2019m tired. I 2019m not tired. o Raheel is hungry. Raheel isn 2019t hungry. o | have four pencils. | don 2019t have four pencils.  2. Interrogative Sentences are what we call question forms and are used to make enquires, to confirm information, and so on. They can be affirmative or negative.  For example o Are you hungry? Aren 2019t you hungry? o Did you do your homework? Didn 2019t you do your homework? o Have you washed the dishes? Haven 2019t you washed the dishes as yet? Exercise 1  Below is a list of sentences. Against each one write what type of sentence it is. For example:  2018declarative affirmative 2019 or  2018interrogative negative 2019 and so on.

(declarative negative) 3. Are these apples tasty? (interrogative affirmative) 4. Aren 2019t these apples raw? (interrogative negative)  Step 1.  Work in groups of four. First, individually, think of a word (table, television, book, etc.). Write a declarative, affirmative sentence using this word. Write this sentence on a sheet of paper and underline the main word. When everyone in the group has written a sentence, pass the sheet to the student sitting on your right.  Step 2.  Look at the sentence you have received, look at the main noun and write a declarative negative sentence using that noun (as shown in the example above).  Step 3.  Once everyone has written, again pass the sheet to the student on the right, follow the same process: look at the key noun and write an interrogative affirmative sentence.  Step 4. Continue the process, until all four members of the group have written the four types of sentences and you get your sheet back.  Step 5.

Autumn versus Spring  There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, autumn and winter. But when it comes to culture and practices, one often sees two seasons receiving more attention than the others. These two seasons are spring and autumn. In many parts of the world, the arrival of these two seasons is celebrated in various ways. However, there are obvious differences between the two seasons.  Spring is the time of the year when the weather is considered as absolutely perfect, because the air is still cool, yet, it is pleasantly cool, a coolness that allows one to enjoy the weather, without getting cramped due to the cold or exhausted due to the heat. The spring season is also associated with rebirth. This is the time of the year when winter comes to an end and activity begins in plant, animal and human life. One can see new leaves on plants and colourful buds on trees that slowly change to green. Animals that sleep or slow down their activities in winter, start becoming more active, searching for food and preparing for an active summer life. Humans also become more active, with some getting the land ready for growing crops, and others doing work that has to be done before the heat of summer drains their "}

Autumn, on the other hand, gives the signal that summer is over.It is the time of the year when preparation for the winter starts. The leaves of the plants start changing colours once again, but this time they change into different shades of yellow, brown and red, and begin to fall off. The trees, instead of getting fully covered, as in spring, start shedding leaves and, ultimately, become barren, with a few leaves or none left at all. The animals start hoarding their food in preparation for  the winter. The people have to work faster to get home quicker, as the days get shorter and night falls very quickly. Those working in the fields get busy reaping their crops and selling or storing their crops. In some parts of the world, people gather around fires and have fun.  All in all, spring gives the signal that winter has ended, and autumn gives the signal that summer is over. With spring comes the message of a new beginning, with green plants and trees. With autumn come the falling green, red and brown leaves and barren trees. Spring is a call for action, and autumn announces more resting time, with longer winter nights about to come.

Pick up one slip at a time and discuss why that quality is good and how it can make life better for an individual and for the society in which we live.  Reading Text The Last Sermon of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W)  Our Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) is the last of the Prophets. Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) was born in 571 AD at Makkah Saudi Arabia, in a respected Quraish family. The Quraish used to worship idols and did not believe in one God. Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), asked the Quraish not to worship their false gods. He told them that he was the Prophet of Allah and asked them to accept Islam and to worship the One and only true God. Most of them refused to accept Islam. They thought that he was against their gods and their ancestors . They opposed this new faith so much that the Prophet (S.A.W) had to ask the believers to migrate to Yathrib, a city 320 km (200 miles) north of Makkah.  But, with time, as many people started accepting his message and converting to Islam, the Quraish became more aggressive and started making attempts on his life. Hence, when Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) got positive signals from Yathrib, he also decided to emigrate there. After eight days 2019 journey, he reached the outskirts of Yathrib, on 28 00b0 June 622; but he did not enter the city directly. He stopped at a place called Quba 2019, a place some miles from the main city, and built a mosque there.  On 2\"4 July 622, Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) entered the city. This event is known as 2018Hijra 2019and marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Yathrib was soon renamed Madinat un-Nabi (literally \"City of the Prophet\"), but un-Nabi was soon dropped, and its name became \"Madina\"} meaning \"the city\".

His message of  2018Unity, Faith and Discipline 2019 and his determination and steadfastness, if made the guiding principles by the nation, can speedily set the nation on the path of progress and prosperity.  He was one of the top barristers of Bombay. But his greatest achievement, which is unparalleled in the recent history of the world, is the creation of Pakistan. The world has seen many leaders who have obtained independence for their people from undesired rulers, but few have achieved what the Quaid-e-Azam did; he created a new country. He led the Muslims of the sub-continent to achieve an independent state called Pakistan, where they could live honourably, according to the teachings of their faith and culture.  Regards.

Now, here is some more information about him:  Political Acumen and Coniribution  Initially, Quaid-e-Azam was a strong proponent of Hindu-Muslim unity and an active member of the Indian National Congress. But, as an outstanding political leader, he very soon sensed that the Indian National Congress was leading the Hindus of the sub-continent towards Hindu-Muslim polarization. This, he realized, would result in political and economic victimization of the Muslims in the region. Therefore, he decided to leave the Congress and join the Muslim League.  Soon after joining the Muslim League he became its president. He, very intelligently, pleaded the case of a separate homeland for the Muslims and succeeded in getting Pakistan. This was despite strong opposition from the two big power players in British India; the ruling British and the majority Hindus.  Have you found some more information?  Tahira    "}

We are starting in the days when there is no discrimination, no distinction between one community and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one State. 201d  He also wanted Pakistan to be a state where justice and merit prevailed. He wanted the people of Pakistan to be united and to work towards making this new country, an exemplary state. He said:  201cMy guiding principle will be justice and complete impartiality and | am sure that with your support and cooperation, | can look forward to Pakistan becoming one of the greatest nations of the world. 201d  Alas! This great leader had to leave this world before he could transform his ideals into practical steps. It is now our responsibility to set the future directions for this great country by implementing the Quaid 2019s vision of Pakistan. If we truly want to pay homage to our great Quaid, we should try and do the things he wanted us to do and not merely praise what he did. On every Independence Day, we should think of what we need to do to take Pakistan forward on the way to peace and prosperity.  Tahira, | think we now have enough information about the Quaid-e-Azam.

He began his professional career as a Professor of Arabic at the Oriental College, Lahore, after doing his M.A., in 1899. In 1905, he went to London to study law and received a law degree. He thus became a barrister by profession. But this does not mean that he gave up everything else. This versatile person continued his quest for knowledge in various fields and, in 1908, he was awarded a Ph.D. degree by the Munich University, in Germany, for his work on Persian philosophy. That is why he is also known as Dr. Muhammad Iqbal.  Regards Lubna    "}

Here 2019s the information that | have found:  Political Acumen and Contribution  Allama Iqbal also took an active part in politics and worked for the cause of the Muslims of South Asia. He was elected as a member of the Punjab Legislative Council in 1926, a post he held till 1929. By then, he had become deeply involved with the Muslim League activities. Due to his commitment to the cause of Muslim rights in India, he was soon elected as the President of the Punjab branch of the All India Muslim League, a post he held till the time of his death.  One of Iqbal 2019s biggest political contributions is his Allahabad address, which he delivered in 1930, when he presided over the Allahabad meeting of the All-India Muslim League. It was on this historic occasion that he made a definite demand for a separate Muslim State in South Asia. In his presidential address, Dr. Iqbal said,  201cIndia is a continent of human groups belonging to different races, speaking different languages, and believing in different religions.... The Muslim demand to create a Muslim India within India is in no way without justice. For my part | would like to go one step further; | would like to see the Punjab, North West Frontier Province, Sindh and Baluchistan unite under a single Muslim State 201d. However this demand shocked both the Hindus and the British alike and they both opposed it. This demand for a separate state for Muslims took such firm root that at its meeting in Lahore, on March 23, 1940, the Muslim League passed a resolution demanding a separate state for the Muslims of India. This resolution is known as the Pakistan Resolution. From this point onwards, all efforts were directed towards this end, culminating in the creation of Pakistan, on August 14, 1947.  Best wishes.

{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "English", "page_218": "UNIT 1.1 READING COMPREHENSION  At the time of arrival of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) in Madina, the city had four broad groups of people. There were the Muslims; including those who were from Madina and those who had emigrated from Makkah. Then, there were the hypocrites; that is those who embraced Islam in name only, but actually were against it. Additionally, there were the people from Aws and Khazraj, who were still pagans but were likely to accept Islam. Finally, there were the Jews, who were huge in number and formed an important community there.  In order to ensure that all these people lived peacefully with each other, Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) invited the leading personalities of all the communities to discuss this matter. He wanted the different groups to reach a formal agreement for harmony among the communities and for the security of the city of Madina. He succeeded in drawing up the Constitution of Madina, also known as the Charter of Madina, through which a kind of understanding was developed among all the communities living in Madina. It mentioned the rights and duties of the Muslims and the Jews of Madina, gave freedom of religion, and prohibited any alliance with the outside enemies. It also declared that any dispute would be referred to Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) for settlement. In later years, he unified the different Arab tribes under Islam, carried out social and religious reforms, and administrative developments that further consolidated the Islamic community in Madina.  In the year 10 A.H., Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) undertook his farewell pilgrimage to Makkah. This farewell pilgrimage is one of the most significant historical events for the Muslims, for it was the first and last pilgrimage made by Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), as well as an occasion when he taught Muslims how to perform the Hajj. Moreover, it was during this Hajj, that he delivered his last sermon in the Uranah valley of Mount Arafat, on the 9\" of Dhu al-Hijjah, 10 A.H. (6\"\" March 632). There were countless Muslims present with the Prophet (S.A.W) during his last pilgrimage when he delivered his last Sermon.  Delivering his last sermon, Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) first of all praised and thanked Allah, and then said, \"O people, lend me an attentive ear, for | know not whether, after this year, | shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore, listen to what | am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today. 201d "}
