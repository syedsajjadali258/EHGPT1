In particular it is central to the mathematics students meet atschool. It provides a connection between algebra and geometry throughgraphs of lines and curves.The algebraic study of geometry with the help of coordinate system iscalled co-ordinate geometry / analytical geometry.This enables geometrical problems to be solved algebraically and provides geometricinsights into algebra. It is a part of geometry in which ordered pairs of numbersare used to describe the position of a point on a plane. Here, the concept ofcoordinate geometry (also known as Cartesian geometry) and its formulasand their derivations will be explained.16.1.2 Derive distance formula to calculate the distancebetween two given points in the Cartesian planeStatement:The distance between any two pointsP,(x,,4,) and P,(x,,Y,)is denoted as|P,P,|and is defined as: _Titowd_ -*PP,|=(%2-2122) +(00a5o-00a5) g| 1 , 27% 2741 inpuimtesDerivation of the Distance Formula 00a9Let P,(x,,y,) and P;(x,,y,) be the %any two points in plane. 0 a, hR "}

In 1631, Professor Henry Briggs developedthe tables with base 201c10201d.By the use of logarithms the enormous labour of calculations isreduced and it is performed with great ease.2.1 Scientific NotationScientific notation is special form to write very large or very smallnumbers conveniently.2.1.1 Express a number in standard form of scientific notationand vice versaIn the world of science and technology; we deal with very large andsmall numbers and quantities, the distance from the earth to the sun is150,000,000 km approximately and weight of hydrogen atom is0.000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,001,7g.The writing of such type ofnumbers in ordinary notation(Standard notation) is too difficult foreveryone and it is time consuming. Scientists have developed aconvenient method to write very small and very large numbers that iscalled scientific notation.The above mentioned number in section 2.1.1 can be simplywritten in scientific notation as: 1.5 x 108 km and 1.7 x 10grespectively.-eZi/&SZz|CF q"}

Thetextbooks are also aimed at inculcating the ingredients of universal brotherhood toreflect the valiant deeds of our forebears and portray the illuminating patterns of our richcultural heritage and tradition.The new editions include introductory paragraphs, information boxes,summaries and a variety of extensive exercises which I think will not only develop theinterest but also add a lot to the utility of the book.The Sindh Textbook Board has taken great pains and incurred expenditure inpublishing this book inspite of its limitations. A textbook is indeed not the last word andthere is always room for improvement. While the authors have tried their level best tomake the most suitable presentation, both in terms of concept and treatment, there maystill have some deficiencies and omissions.

It is written as x = antilog y. Ifthe common logarithm of a number x is y, i.e. if log x = y, then we findthe number x by using the tables of antilogarithms and with the help offollowing two rules.Rule1. _ If the characteristic is non negative n, then antilog must haven+1 digits in integral part.Rule 2. _ If the characteristic is negative n, then antilog must have n-1zeros immediately following the decimal point.The procedure of finding antilogarithms is explained by thefollowing examples Antilogarithm TablePp jo Mean Differences _|evs e sss Teles Pee stepyreys[00 [r002| 1005 [1007] 10091012] 1074 ore] rosa rors foooo] ofoTa fafa fa] 2]2]2][01 [1023 1026 [1028] 1030] 1033] 1035] 1038] oso fiona froasfofoTa fafa fa] 2]2]2][02 [roar 1050] 1052] 1054] 1057] 1059] 1062] 1068 foe} oes] ofofa fifi faf2]2]2|[03 [ro7a| 107s [i076] 1073] 1081] ro8a]f tone] 1089 soon} rosef ofofa fafa [a2] 2]2]@ <= \\\\<% @ = \\ 7 &  "}
