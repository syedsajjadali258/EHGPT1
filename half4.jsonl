The plumb line indicates whether the balance is horizontal. In ideal condition the plumb line is aligned with the end of the knob fixed with the pillar. When the beam is horizontal the pointer remains on zero mark on the ivory scale. The whole box has leveling screws at the bottom to set it to horizontal. The device is enclosed in a glass box to avoid wind effects.The Electronic Balance  The digital mass meter is an electronic instrument configured with integrated circuits and it works on the principal of balancing the forces.The device is turned on and set to zero then object is placed on the plate. The reading on the screen gives the mass of object.

Each country that subscribed to the International Metric Convention was assigned one or more copies of the international standards; these are known as National Prototype Meter and Kilogram.Fig 1.19 Electronic BalanceFig 1.18 Physical BalanceBeamAgate knifeand agate plateBalancingscrewPointerScalePanArrestment knob Leveling screwWeightsPlumbPillar100mlOIn 20 C Fig 1.19 Electronic BalanceThe Standard of Time   Before 1960, the standard of time was defined in terms of the mean solar day for the year 1900. The rotation of the Earth is now known to vary slightly with time, this motion is not a good one to use for defining a time standard.  In 1967, the second was redefined to take advantage of the high precision attainable in a device known as an atomic clock(Fig 1.20), which uses the characteristic frequency of the cesium-133 atom as the “reference clock”.Fig 1.20 Atomic Clock The second is now defined as 9 192 631 770 times the period of vibration of radiation from the cesium atom.Stop Watch A stopwatch is used to measure the time interval between two events. There are two types of stopwatch : Mechanical stopwatch  and Digital stopwatch.Mechanical / Analogue Stopwatch A mechanical stop  watch can measure a time interval up to 0.1 second .  (Fig1.21)  It has a knob that is Fig. 1.21 Stop Watch  1000g = 1kg1g = 1000mg1g= 1000000 mg1g=1000000000ng1g=0.002lbDo You Know!"}

REST AND MOTION Have a look around in your classroom, You can observe various things like, table, chairs, books etc all are in state of rest. A car is in the state of rest with respect to trees and bushes around it Fig 2.1. Thus rest can be defined as: A train is stationed at the platform. A person can notice that the train does not changes its position with respect to its surroundings, hence the train is in the state of rest Fig 2.2. But as soon  as the train starts moving its position continuously changing with respect to its surroundings. Now we can say that the train is in motion. Thus motion can be defined as:  Kinematics is the branch of Mechanics which deals with motion of objects without reference of force which causes motion.   A body is said to be in rest if it does not change its position with respect to its surroundings.  A body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to its surroundings.Rest and Motion are Relative State No body in the universe is in the state of absolute rest or absolute motion. If a body is at rest with respect to some reference point at the same time, it can also be in the state of motion with respect to some other reference point.  For example, A Passenger sitting in a moving bus is at rest because passenger are not changing their position with respect to other passengers or objects in the bus as shown in fig 2.3. But for another observer outside the bus noticed that the passengers and objects inside the bus are in motion as they are changing their position with respect to observer standing at the road.   Similarly a passenger flying on aeroplane is in motion when observed from ground but at the same times he is at rest with reference to other passengers on board.2.12.2"}

We can also say that the change in momentum is equal to the force multiplied by the time interval for which it was applied. Consider a body of mass m, moving with initial velocity vi. A force F acts on the body to produce acceleration a, therefore the final velocity after time t will become vf.

Momentum is definedas quantity of motion contained in a body. Momentum is product of mass and velocity of a moving object. Hence it is mass times the velocity  (p = mv).Do You Know! We can also say that the change in momentum is equal to the force multiplied by the time interval for which it was applied. Consider a body of mass m, moving with initial velocity vi. A force F acts on the body to produce acceleration a, therefore the final velocity after time t will become vf. Note that if p = mv and m is constant, then the change in velocity changes the momentum of body. Momentum in terms of force:Safety devices: The equation  (3.2)  is important when it comes to consider a number of safety features in our lives. If you are moving, you have momentum. To stop moving, a force must be applied. According to the equation (3.2)  if you take longer time to stop, smaller force will be used to slow down you. Observe a car to identify the safety measures taken to reduce the risk of injuries in case of road accident. The car bumpers and grills are designed to provide extra time to reduce speed before any collision.    p=mvi i         p=mv   f fand  p - p = (mv - mv) change in momentum f i f i        p - p = m (v -v) divide both sides by t f i f i     Since rate of change of velocity is acceleration according to Newton’s second law of motion F=matherefore,            ......................(3.2) Dp = Ft= mv - vf itp - pf itv - vf it= ap - pf it= map- pf it= FWorked Example 2 Therefore"}

This law describes what happens when a body exerts a force on another body.  Many times you through a ball towards wall and it bounces back. If it is thrown with greater force the ball is returned back with greater push. It is because the wall reacts against the action of ball.  While walking on ground you push the ground with feet the ground pushes you back thus you move (Fig. 3.10 a). As these forces always occur in pairs, so when one body pushes against another, the second body pushes back just as hard.For example, when you put a book on table the book pushes the table downward, the table pushes back the book upward (Fig 3.10 b). Thus Newton’s third law of motion can be defined as: Newton’s Third Law of Motion  To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Hold the other end of string and  rotate  the bucket in vertical circle (Fig 3.11). You may feel some pull on your arm. Now put few coins in the bucket, again rotate it. It is amazing the coins do not fall even the bucket goes bottom up. More interesting will be the experimenting with some water. Pour about a cup of water in the bucket. Now try rotating the bucket around and up. How interesting it is? The water stuck to the bottom of bucket. The force that keeps it stuck is known as centrifugal force and the force you apply against the pull on your arm is known as centripetal force.Centripetal Force The force required to move a body along a circular path is called Centripetal force. 3.3   It is denoted by F. The centripetal force is always cdirected towards center of the circular path. It depends on three factors: (i) the velocity of the object v  (ii) the object's distance from the center “r” and (iii) the mass of the object “m”. It is given by relationF = .......................

The maximum static friction is known as “limiting friction”Kinetic friction It is the force that resists  the motion of a moving object. It is interesting to know that in almost all situations, static friction is greater than kinetic friction.Sliding friction When one body slides over the other body the friction between two surfaces is said to be sliding friction.Rolling friction When a body moves on wheels the friction is said to be rolling friction. Rolling friction is much lesser than the sliding friction.Types of Friction In case of rolling friction the contact area between two surfaces is lesser than the contact area in case of sliding bodies. Therefore ball bearings are used in vehicles that they reduce the contact area as compared to the contact area of axel and bush. A pedestal fan with ball bearing saves a lot of electricity therefore the customers always select a fan with ball bearing rather than one with bush and axel.Advantages of Friction Friction enables us to walk on ground. Friction protects from sliding, as sand is thrown to maintain friction on inclined railway tracks during rain. The car brakes slow down the car to stop safely. Threads and grooves are designed on tyres to increase the friction and improve grip between road and wheel  ( Fig 3.18 a). Now vehicles are equipped with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS). ABS is designed to maintain  steering stability, improve vehicle control, avoid skidding and decreases stopping distances on dry and slippery surfaces. The ABS maintains the static friction as the wheel starts slipping it releases the brake automatically for a fraction of a second then holds wheel again to create static friction between road and tyres (Fig 3.18 b).Disadvantages of Friction A large amount of energy is wasted in the machines due to friction. Friction leads to wear and tear of parts hence increases the service cost. Failure of oil pump in car engine results contact between dry metals which yields high temperature hence the car engine is seized.Fig. 3.18 (a) Tyre Grooves improve grip on roadFig 3.18 (b) You might have noticed a logo on some cars"}

Fatima is sitting on right side and Faheem on the left side of the pivot. When the clockwise turning effect of Fatima is equal to the anticlockwise turning effect of Faheem, then see-saw balances.

Force applied by hands on the dough changes its shape; Fig 5.1 (a). A spring can be stretched or compressed by applying force; Fig 5.1 (b).  Notice that, what effect a force has, depends on the materials involved. Soft materials, such as rubber can bend and flex very easily. A spring comes back to its original shape when you remove the force. Materials like this are called elastic. When force is exerted on area, this is known as pressure; Fig 5.1 (c). As you have already studied that hydraulic machines also work on principals of fluid pressure. Hydraulic breaks are used almost in all vehicles. They cause a relatively small force from the driver's foot to be multiplied to produce a greater force, which acts equally on all four brake pads.Force can be defined as  A push or a pull that changes or tends to change the state of rest or uniform motion of an object or changes the direction or shape of an object.Force Solids have definite shapes and sizes, however it is possible to change their shapes and sizes by applying external forces. When the external force is removed, the object tends to return to its original shape and size. This behavior is called elastic behaviour.

To explain how solids are deformed? let us perform an experiment with the spring. Consider a spring hung from a rigid support, so that its top end is fixed; Fig 5.3 (a). Weights are hung on other end of the spring. These are called load. As load is increased, the spring is stretched and its length increases.   When the load is removed, the spring returns to its original length. This is called elastic change. When the load is increased in regular steps the length of the spring also increases simultaneously Fig 5.3 (b). If the load is increased greatly, the spring will change its shape permanently.Extension of spring The length of spring increases as the force (load) increases; Fig 5.3 (b).

The palm pressing the tip feels much more pain than the palm pressing its blunt end. We can push a drawing pin into a wooden board by pressing it by our thumb; Fig 5.7. It is because the force we apply on the drawing pin is confined just at a very small area under its sharp tip. A drawing pin with a blunt tip would be very difficult to push into the board due to the large area of its tip. In these examples, we find that the effectiveness of a small force is increased if the effective area of the force is reduced. The area of the tip of pencil or that of the nail is very small and hence increases the effectiveness of the force. The quantity that depends upon the force and increases with decrease in the area on which force is acting is called pressure. Thus, pressure is defined asHow to calculate pressure If F is the magnitude of a force exerted perpendicular to a given surface of area A, then the pressure P equals to the force divided by the area:Thus,ForceAreaPressure =....(5.2) .......... ..........AFP=Fig 5.6A drawing pin with a sharp tip enters easily when pressed.Fig 5.7Spread area= Low pressureSmall area= High pressure"}

The palm pressing the tip feels much more pain than the palm pressing its blunt end. We can push a drawing pin into a wooden board by pressing it by our thumb; Fig 5.7. It is because the force we apply on the drawing pin is confined just at a very small area under its sharp tip. A drawing pin with a blunt tip would be very difficult to push into the board due to the large area of its tip. In these examples, we find that the effectiveness of a small force is increased if the effective area of the force is reduced. The area of the tip of pencil or that of the nail is very small and hence increases the effectiveness of the force. The quantity that depends upon the force and increases with decrease in the area on which force is acting is called pressure. Thus, pressure is defined asHow to calculate pressure If F is the magnitude of a force exerted perpendicular to a given surface of area A, then the pressure P equals to the force divided by the area:Thus,ForceAreaPressure =....(5.2) .......... ..........AFP=Fig 5.6A drawing pin with a sharp tip enters easily when pressed.Fig 5.7Spread area= Low pressureSmall area= High pressure"}

Both liquids and gases are fluids. The pressure exerted by fluids is known as fluid pressure. It acts in all directions. This is because the molecules of fluids move around in all directions, causing pressure on every surface they collide with.

It solidifies only when it is cooled and compressed. Mercury is the only metal that is not solid at room temperature.FORCES AND KINETIC THEORY When  a gas is cooled (Fig 7.4), the molecules move more slowly and collide with one another, may stick together and force of attraction between molecules increases. Keep cooling the gas and eventually all of the molecules stick together to form a liquid. Further cooling will cause all the molecules to stick together to form a solid.HEATING MELTING BOILINGSOLID LIQUID GAS Why some materials are solid and liquid while others are gases at room conditions?   Forces between the molecules are responsible for the different states of matter as well as for the physical properties. According to the Kinetic molecular model molecules of  gases have large kinetic energy as a result there are no forces of attraction between them as a result molecules of gases can move  freely and go farther apart. This is why gases can occupy any available space and can be compressed easily. Boiling and melting points of gases are also very low because of this reason. The molecules of liquids as compared to that of the gases have less kinetic energy hence intermolecular forces come into play. That is why the molecules of liquids are very close to each other but still free to move. therefore liquids do not have fixed shape but fixed volume. The melting and boiling points of liquids are also high as compared to gases. The molecules of solids have extremely lowest  energies therefore experience strong attractive forces and can not move freely but only have small vibrations about  mean positions. this gives solid a fixed shape and volume. That is why densities, melting and boiling points of solids are very high.        As a result we are able  to convert water into ice, cream into ice cream, natural gas into compressed natural gas 'CNG' etc. The state of a substance  can be changed either by heating or by cooling it. on the other hand when a solid substance (Fig7.3) is heated,  the molecules start to vibrate more and more strongly. Eventually, the molecules vibrate more violently and inter molecular forces become weak. As a result 'material becomes a 7.2liquid,'if process of  heating is continued further, then molecules have sufficient energy to overcome all of the attractive forces as a result 'substance  becomes a gas'.Fig 7.3Table 7.2 Boiling and melting points of some pure substancesSubstanceMelting point (⁰C) Boiling point (⁰C)Helium -272 -269Oxygen -218 -183Nitrogen -191 -177Mercury -39 257Water 0 100Iron 2080 3570Diamond (Carbon)4100 5400Tungsten 3920 6500"}

Because air molecules apply pressure on the rubber walls of balloon hence it gets inflated. Pressure of a gas can also be increased by compressing it.

The gas molecules have been compressed into a smaller volume so they will collide more frequently with the walls of container and creates more pressure. If the gas is compressed to half its original volume its pressure will be doubled.PresssureFig.7.6 (c)Fig.7.6 (d)Low pressure High pressureFig.7.6 (a) Fig.7.6 (b)Wall Wall"}

The gas has no definite volume because the molecules of the gas are far away from each other and can move freely at high speeds. Therefore gas always takes up the shape and volume of its container.For example, the smell of a perfume quickly spreads through the room as soon you spray it at your body or clothes. Because, the molecules move freely and randomly at high speeds through out the room.Volume of a gas can also be increased by decreasing its pressure. This could be done by reducing the load on the piston of the gas container. As the gas molecules are in random motion (Fig 7.8) they quickly covers the whole space and the volume increases. If the gas is compressed to half its original volume its pressure will be doubled. Temperature The temperature of a gas is determined by the average translational  kinetic energy of its molecules. If a gas is heated the average translational  kinetic energy of its molecules increases and temperature of the gas rises. If a gas is cooled down the average translational kinetic energy of its molecules decreases and temperature of the gas falls.

In that case, we define the work by the force as the product of the component of the force along the line of motion and the distance “d”; the body moves along that line, i.e.Suppose a constant force “F” acts on a body     Work = (component of force) · (distance)     W = (F cosθ) d or     W = (F cosθ) d      If       θ = 0 Þ cosθ = 1then      Work = W= FdWorked Example 1Find the work done when a force of 50N is applied to move a trolley at a shopping mall through a distance of 200m? oAssume the angle to be of 0 between the force and the distance the trolley moved.SolutionStep 1:  Write down known quantities and quantities to be found.

Materials change their states due to change in their temperature, cause by the addition or removal of heat. Like for example, water changes from liquid to gas 'steam' due to addition of heat or to solid 'ice' due to removal of heat. The process of evaporation, boiling, freezing, thermal expansion (liner and volumetric) are all happens due to the change in temperature of the substance. Thus changes in temperature caused by the addition or removal of heat play very important role in our daily life.     Students Learning Outcomes (SLOs)After learning this unit students should be able to: lDifferentiate between heat and temperaturelDefine the terms heat capacity and specific heat capacity with SI unit lDescribe one everyday effect due to relatively large specific heat of water lDescribe heat of fusion and heat of vaporization (as energy transfer without a change of temperature for change of state) lDescribe experiments to determine heat of fusion and heat of vaporization of ice and water respectively by sketching temperature-time graph on heating ice. lExplain the process of evaporation and the difference between boiling and evaporation. lExplain that evaporation causes cooling lList the factors which influence surface evaporation lDefine thermal expansion lDescribe qualitatively the thermal expansion of solids (linear and volumetric expansion) lList and explain some of the everyday applications and consequences of thermal expansion lExplain the thermal expansion of liquids (real and apparent expansion)"}

The result of this  silent and wise preaching style was that Hazrat Abu Bakr 4425 was the first among the men, Hazrat Khadija Kzaiie5 among the women, Zaid bin Haritha 200a34ii25 among the slaves and Hazrat Ali 44iic2) among the children  embraced Islam. At that time, The Holy Prophet pssabsiigiveskiits kept  the practice of invitation and preaching secret as it was the requirement of the time and circumstances.

Sa'fa Hill: After conveying the message of Allah Almighty to the relatives and the people of Makkah on Safa Hill, Allah Almighty ordered The Holy Prophet disalecisaiuesaeatiis to spread this message on a wide scale in order to invite the nation. The Holy Qur'an says:  201cWe have revealed to you the Qur'an in Arabic, so you may warn the people of Makkah and the people around it.201d (Surah Al-Shu'ra: 7).

He also went to Ta'if to preach Islam. He remained busy inviting the people to Allah Almighty for about ten days.  Principles of Invitation and Preaching: As Allah Almighty has commanded the preaching of Islam in the Holy Quran, He has also  mentioned its principles and conditions. The Divine command is: (73!  5c) Besa saKodL aig Jess 2018esi uble (Surah Al-Nahal: 125) Translation:  \"Call people to the path of your Lord with wisdom and kind advice and debate within a better way\".  In this verse, three principles of invitation and preaching have been stated. To make any effort effective, the same principles are adopted. They are as follows:  1. Wisdom, 2. Kind advice and 3. Debate in the best manner.  Preaching with wisdom: The talk should be according to the level of  the addressee. Willingness to listen should be created. The invitation  and preaching should be wisely according to the audience's mental capacity. So it should be with scientific and rational reasoning ~ according to the situation and occasion.  Kind advice: There is definitely an effect of speaking in a good manner. To speak effectively by showing the good and the bad in front of the addressee so that no one is hurt and everyone is convinced for the truth is termed \"kind advice\".  Debate and discussion: If there comes a situation of discussion or dialogue in order to say one's opinion, then discussion should be full _ of arguments, and in order to disprove the opinion of the opponent, then the language should be in a good and polite manner, in which "}

Allah Almighty says:5  It is also essential for the preacher to act on what he preaches to others, as Allah Almighty says in the Holy Qur'an: 201cAnd who is better in speech than he who calls (people) to Allah and does good deeds.201d (Surah Fussilat: 33)  Effects and Fruits of Invitation and preaching: In the beginning, one of the Ansar of Medina, Suwaid bin Samit, who was famous for his bravery and poetry, came to Makkah during the Hajj period. After hearing a few verses of the Qur'an from the blessed tongue of The Holy Prophet Acsalezi jal Mesarleatids, he got convinced of the reality of Islam. Then his conversion to Islam affected other people of Medina. As a result, some people of Medina embraced Islam within only two or three years. Afterwards, the migration of Muslims from Makkah to Medina began. The Muslims went to Medina and became strong. Then The Holy Prophet pcspasiialucsaeaifs also migrated from Makkah and came to Medina. After arriving, he laid the foundation of a mosque there. The Holy Prophet Aasaleclsal esareaii te made agreements with the tribes of Medina and its surroundings.  After the battle of Badr, the battle of Uhud, the battle of Trench and  the treaty of Hudaybiya, The Holy Prophet dss lasiiaiesaeatiis wrote letters  of invitation and preaching to the kings. Khyber was conquered. Truth \\  conquered, and falsehood was defeated, i.e., Makkah was conquered.  As a result of invitation and preaching, on the occasion of Farewell Hajj, more than one lac companions prepared for Hajj. Therefore, we should also strive for the duty of invitation to religion and preaching of Islam wholeheartedly so that the religion of Allah Almighty prevails and we may prosper in both worlds.

The Relationship of Husband and Wife: The existence and sustenance of humanity is based on the relationship between a man and a woman. Therefore, the relationship of husband and wife has an important place in all relationships of humankind. A marriage bond is established after the parents2019 consent from both sides and the process of requesting and accepting the Nikkah. This bondage brings so many benefits. It leads to a decent and chaste society. The Holy Quran named this bondage of marriage 2018Ahsaun2019 which means to be protected within a fortress. Actually, Nikkah is an agreement through which husband and wife become lifelong companions and benefactors of one another. They accompany sorrows and happiness and help each other at difficult times. Solace in life and heart satisfaction depends on the loving relationship between husband and wife. The more they love each other, the more happiness will exist in the family. Nikkah is not only the cause of sustaining humanity but also protects a man from many immoralities. A new clan emerges when a child is born.

In this age, respect for humanity was almost lost. People used to respect stones, trees, rivers, oceans, sun, moon, stars and other powerful things. They used to worship these non-living baseless things considering them diety. They would make requests to them and slaughter animals for them. Some pagans even sacrificed their offspring in front of them to get the closeness of these deities.  Islam falsified all these polytheistic rituals and notions. It taught the dignity of humanity to humans, and along with this, it discouraged  the attributes of proudness and self-praising. The Holy Prophet cic  Aa saslealsall yes proclaimed among humans that: O People! You all are the  offspring of one father whose birth is with dust.

Modesty is an attribute of a believer as the Holy Prophet 00abaij  Assalecisalyes declared it a branch of faith: (Arabic Text) (Bukhari: 9,  Muslim: 30) Translation: 201cAnd modesty is a branch of Iman.201d. Modesty is an attribute which secures a person from the worst transgressions. A person who does not possess this attribute, becomes careless from sins and evildoings, nor is he ashamed of doing so. Respective to this, the Holy Prophet phos leat sali es agle abi Ls said, 201cWhen you do not have modesty, so do whatever you want.201d (Sunan Abi Dawood, Hadith: 4797)  Abu Sa2019id Al-Khudri 44ii00a2e5 reports, 201cMessenger of Allah sGaije  Assalseisaiyes was even shier than a virgin behind her veil. When he saw something which he disliked, we could perceive it on his face.201d  Hazrat Abu Huraira 424i\\5 reports that the Holy Prophet x&aiic Assalesisaiyes said, 201cIman has over seventy branches, and modesty is a  branch of Iman.201d (Bukhari: 9, Muslim: 30)  Hazrat Abdullah Ibn Umar 424i!(25 reports that the Holy Prophet  Aasalestsalpesareati he said, 201cModesty and belief are together.

He smashes virtuous passions and embezzles the wealth of the poor without feeling any mercy in his heart. He sees humanity in trouble, but it does not affect him. His self-centeredness keeps his sight in the darkness. A person who reaches this low level, comes out of the boundaries of humanity.  Manifestation of Modesty and Chastity: Modesty relates not only to the character and action of a person, but it also has much influence on his thoughts and way of speech. Therefore, every human being, especially Muslim males and females, should include modesty in their lifestyle to be a respectful citizen of society and a prepared person for the hereafter. Following are the practices that must reflect modesty and chastity.  Speech: It is inappropriate for a Muslim to abuse or talk using obscene words or manners. Instead, he should either speak good or remain silent. He should avoid a rude temper and keep himself away from useless discussions. It is the modesty of speech.  Dress: Islam has outlined two objectives of dressing, one is covering, and the second is beautification. Thus, men and women should wear a modest dress that covers the standard of Shariah covering. Thus, a dress that is against modesty and veiling or resembles the opposite gender is against modesty and chastity.  Attitude in daily life: A true believer should avoid an immodest / attitude in all his activities in daily life. The Holy Quran orders men and women to lower their eyes and protect their modesty. Likewise, they should not see anything obscene or think something vulgar. As Allah Almighty says, 201cAllah well knows the covert glance and all that lies hidden in the hearts.201d (Surah Al-Momin: 19)  Gathering: A person also spends his time in gatherings, meetings or celebrations. During all these gatherings, a believer is bound to retain modesty in his actions, speech and manners.  Requisites of Modesty:  e A person should secure his tongue from offensive words.

This is a gift of honour in the shape of cash and any valuable thing. Islam has declared Mehr as the property of the wife, which she can use as she wants. The husband cannot interfere in its usage.  If Mehris paid in time, it is called 201cMehr-e-Mu2019ajjal2019; if its payment is delayed, it is called 201cMehr-e-Muajal2019.

Hayyan bin Abdullah used to trade perfume (itr). Thus, as he came to Tous, he sarted his perfume shop.  Jabir was born a few months after opening the perfume shop. Hence, he acquired his early education under the supervision of his father in Tous. As he used to get free from his institution, he would come to the perfume shop with his father. First, he used to observe and ask about the things there. Later, he started to help his father in the business.

Furthermore, the guardian of the orphans are instructed as follows:  If the orphan children have attained the age of puberty and they do not know to protect their property and do not know how to use it, or they are afraid of wasting their property by their simplicity and unawareness, then do not hand over their property to them as it is the source of their livelihood and survival because the wealth is the source of income.

(Surah Al-Hashr: 7)  In this verse, the Ummah has been commanded to accept all the  orders and teachings of the Holy Prophet pisqlasisaigesaeaids and to refrain from the practices that are forbidden. In a Hadith, the Holy MK  Prophet Aasalesisaissaticaii<said: 201cWhosoever holds fasts to my Sunnah  during the turmoil of my Ummah, there is a reward of a hundred martyrs, for him.201d (Hilyat ul Awliya by Isfahani: vol: 8, p. 200)  Hadith and Sunnah are essential in our lives because Hadith and Sunnah are, in fact, the interpretation and explanation of the commandments of the Holy Qur'an. There are many commandments in the Holy Qur'an whose explanation is impossible without Prophetic interpretation. For example, the number of Rak'ats of the prayer, its principles, details of recitation. What should be avoided while fasting? What is the specific amount of wealth for paying Zakat, and what is  2019 meant by the kinds of wealth on which Zakat becomes payable? How to  perform Hajj rituals? How to perform all these acts of worship in practical life? We can know their answers only through Hadith and Sunnah of the  ii,  Messenger of Allah pssasleclsal ssaeetids and his blessed life.  The Companions were in front in obedience of the Holy Prophet jz Assalasisaigeseteei! and following his Sunnah.

In Islamic Shariah, Dua means to ask something from Allah Almighty believing Him Almighty and requesting Him for any favour. Dua is a means of attaining the goal. As a servant makes efforts to fulfill his needs and wants, Dua is also a similar effort.  The words \"There is no god except Allah\" (La ilaha illallah) only teach us to believe in Allah Almighty alone. Therefore, it is called \"the words of Tauheed and the words of faith\". In all forms of remembrance (Zikrs), this phrase is called the best remembrance because it is the essence of all the attributes of perfection and superiority in majesty and exaltation. This phrase is the most effective in purifying the inner-self and turning the heart towards Allah Almighty from all sides. By confessing and believing in this phrase with faith and sincerity, a man enters Islam and becomes entitled to enter Paradise. Saying Al-hamdulillah is also a word of remembrance, but in reality, it is also a supplication (Dua), because the blessings and effects of Al-hamdulillah increase good deeds and remove sins.

Explanation: This Hadith explains the significance of acquiring knowledge. In the present age, knowing all kinds of information and having access to all sciences and arts is interpreted as \"knowledge\". However, in the early days of Islam, knowledge was meant to be the knowledge of the Holy Qur'an and Hadith in particular, through which a person may attain nearness to his Creator and Master and recognize every good and bad so that good deeds could be performed and sins could be avoided.  There are two levels of knowledge:  1) Knowledge as exact duty: It is the duty of every man, whether male or female, to learn so much knowledge through which he/she can recognize the essentials of faith, lawful (Halal) and unlawful (Haraam), pure and impure, and his/her responsibilities.  (2) Knowledge as sufficient duty: To acquire complete knowledge of religion and worldly sciences and arts is a sufficient duty. Therefore, in this Hadith, seeking knowledge has been made obligatory on individual and collective levels. This includes men as well as women so that they  can train future generations on Islamic guidelines and a righteous \\  society required by Islam can be formed.  Hence, we should try to acquire knowledge and use it for virtuous and needful things and to avoid harmful things so that we can succeed in both worlds.

However, this word has come much in the meaning of prayer than any other. It is obligatory on every sane, mature Muslim man and woman to offer prayers five times a day. Through prayer, the bondage of a servant maintains its relation and connection with Allah Almighty. It is only through prayers that one attains nearness to Allah Almighty, His mercy and His pleasure. He who does not offer prayers, his connection and relation become weak. The Holy Qur'an has commanded us to take care of it in many places such as, \"Establish prayers and pay Zakat\". (Surah Al-Baqarah: 43).  The Holy Prophet dasalesisaiueseatiiesaid: \"The foundation of Islam is based on five things: a. Testimony of Tawheed and Prophethood,  establishing prayers, paying Zakat, Fasting (in the month of Ramdan) and Performing Hajj to Baitullah.

Defending and protecting the country's borders by making a small fortification has also been counted as Jihad.

It is stated in this Hadith that if the Mujahideen (those who fight for the sake of Allah) defend the borders one day or one night, they will get a reward better than fasting during the day and offering additional prayers (Tahajjud) at night for the whole month.

Allah Almighty says: \"Indeed We have honoured the children of Adam\". (Surah al-Isra: 70). All the believers are declared brothers to one another. It has also been emphasized to treat relatives, neighbours, friends and travellers well.  Further, Allah Almighty commands the believers to do goodness and kindness towards other people so that a peaceful and virtuous society may be formed. It is especially emphasized to love young children, treat them with love and compassion, pay their rights and so on. Likewise, we are ordered to respect the elders.

The Holy Prophet sigesaseaiis  dssaleeis said: 201cPerform Hajj and Umrah voluntarily (Nafil), for they  remove poverty and sins as the bellows (of ironsmith and goldsmith) removes impurity from iron, gold and silver, and Hajj Al-Mabrur brings no less reward than Paradise.201d (Sunan An-Nisa'i: 2631). Moreover, it is instructed in this Hadith that a person should show patience during Hajj. He should avoid immodest words, lousy speech or any nonsense act which falls within the limits of disobedience to Allah Almighty. Likewise, a pilgrim should refrain from illegal and unlawful acts, quarrels and sins. Nevertheless, if he asks \\ forgiveness of shortcomings committed in the rights of Allah Almighty and compensates for the shortcomings committed in human rights, he 00bb ~~ will be cleansed from sins as he was on the day when he was born.

Hence, Muslims should take care of these rights conscientiously. Allah Almighty says, 201cThe believers are brothers to one another.201d (Surah al- Hujurat: Verse: 10).

Hadith No. 18: cal iiplalibl (Kanzul Ummal, Hadith: 28697-28698) Translation: 201cSeek knowledge even if from China.201d  Explanation: This Hadith highlights the greatness of knowledge and its necessity. The fundamental requisite of human nature is to know every good and bad thing about himself and the universe. Man cannot  ' progress in the world without knowledge, and it is necessary to endure  hard work and severeness to acquire knowledge. Without these efforts, there can be no maturity and excellence in knowledge. Therefore, if the hardship in the journey of acquiring knowledge comes across to him, he should bear it. The great narrators of Hadith, scholars and scientists of the past times used to travel long distances to acquire knowledge and bear the hardships of travel and migration. That is why even today, their names are remembered with honour. This Hadith guides us that if we have to go to China (or any distant place) to acquire various sciences and arts, we should go and bear the hardships of acquiring knowledge. Hence, we should work hard for the acquisition of knowledge, even if we  _ have to travel long distances, to bear the journey and hardship so that  we can achieve spiritual and worldly progress. "}

This Hadith is very significant in terms of transformation and training. Islam gives particular importance to sincerity in all virtues. It means that whatever good deed is done, it should only be done for the pleasure of Allah Almighty. It should not be for worldly purposes such as showing off, seeking fame or compensation. Seeking fame should be avoided. In all human deeds, the heart of man and the right intention and devotion have primary importance. A person must think about the heart's condition and tendency. If it is an act of sincerity and piety, it will be accepted by Allah Almighty, and it will be rewarded. On the contrary, if any worldly interest is intended in action, only that worldly interest will be obtained. There will be no reward for this action in the sight of Allah in the Hereafter.

{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "Islamiat", "page_136": "Explanation: In this Hadith, a number of branches of faith are  mentioned, i.e., the declaration \"La ilaha illa Allah2019, shame and modesty and the virtue of removing the painful thing from the path. \"Iman\" (Faith) is the name of firm belief in the fundamental and essential precepts of Islam and to confess this belief with one's tongue. Therefore, it is stated that there are more than sixty or seventy branches of perfect faith, in which the highest branch is to say \"La ilaha illa Allah2019, because it is through this that Tawheed is confessed, which is the foundation of faith. Other branches of faith include beliefs, good deeds, good morals, and the inner and outer aspects of virtues. The last moral branch of faith is that the believer has the quality of protecting other people from suffering. So anything along the way, if it causes trouble to the passers- by, its removal is an act of reward and virtue.  Among the branches of faith, \"modesty\" is also a significant branch which is the source of goodness. Modesty is a quality that prevents a person from immoralities and many evils and sins. Therefore, a person with this quality is not tempted by evil. Instead, he will move towards good.

Explanation: This Hadith instructs to do good and righteous deeds and to cooperate with each other on goodness and righteous deeds. The Holy Qur'an commands one another to cooperate in righteousness and good deeds while forbidding one another from helping in sin and disobedience. (Surah al-Ma'idah: Verse: 2).

The Holy Prophet a00e9an is  Assa\\ecisaiuss encouraged to fulfill the needs and explained the reward  of giving respite to the distressed debtor. Two factors have been clarified about human rights; it is also interpreted as social welfare. These two factors are as follows:  1. If a believer is in trouble, pain or distress, it is an excellent act of worship to relieve his distress and assist him in such a situation. The Holy Prophet dss estsaiuesaieatiis said: 201cAllah Almighty is at the back of a servant so long as the servant is at the back of his brother.201d (Sahih Muslim, Hadith: 2699).  2. If a believer is sick, destitute, poor or needy, it is a great reward to serve him and help him financially. If a debtor has taken a loan from someone, giving him respite in his debt is also a great reward. Allah Almighty will bring ease for him in this world and in the hereafter. Hence, if anyone in our society suddenly comes to a calamity, we should strive to save him from the calamity and offer our services to help him. We should also encourage others to do the same so that the people of our society can live prosperous life. This practice will ensure blessings in both worlds.

In this Hadith, the Holy Prophet dssalest sali Qesatieiijsinstructed to serve the neighbour and to protect him from troubles and afflictions.

Maintaining good relations with kin: Sharing in the sorrows of one's relatives and kin, coming to their aid in time of need, treating them well, and adopting a sympathetic attitude towards them is termed as \"Sila-e-Rahmi' (maintaining good relations with kin). It is narrated in  a Hadith that the Holy Prophet Acsalesiisiesateatits said: 201cWhoever wants that he be granted more wealth and that his lease of life be  prolonged, then he should keep good relations with his kin.201d (Sahih Al- Bukhari, Hadith: 2067).  Speaking good or remaining silent: It is commanded in the Holy Qur'an: E25 luis (Surah Al-Bagarah: 83), Translation: \"Speak good to people\". What does not hurt the people is a good speech. Therefore, a believer should speak well to the people and avoid unnecessary and nonsensical talk or remain silent. If he cannot benefit anyone, at least he should save them from any harm.

If there is a good intention, it is \"good conjecture\"} which is a good quality. It has been encouraged in the Hadith, especially to have a good conjecture of Allah Almighty is an act of worship.

The word 201cNubuwwat201d is derived from 201cNaba201d, which literally means news. And the one who gives news is called a 201cNab? (Prophet), the plural of which is 201cAmbiyaa201d (Prophets).

In religious terminology, 201cProphethood and Apostleship201d is a high  spiritual position on which Allah Almighty has appointed chosen 201c  servants from among His servants. Through which man attains divine knowledge. This means that Prophethood and Apostleship is a position that serves as a link between Allah Almighty and His servants. Through it, Allah Almighty conveys His commands and instructions to His servants. And through them, He guides and corrects and trains human beings. The person who holds this position is called a Prophet or a  Messenger. Even before receiving the divine message, the status of the  Messenger is high in his nation.

Islam has stated 201cworship and obedience to Allah Almighty201d as the purpose of man2019s creation and life. It can occur only through the practical guidance of Prophets and Messengers. Therefore, the salvation of man in this world and the Hereafter also depends on Prophetic guidance.  2. Man naturally wants an example or pattern before his eyes for practical life, by which he can mould his living. The life of the Prophets is the best practical example for people to follow.  3. Allah Almighty reveals the Book on the Prophet and the Messenger for the guidance of His servants. A Prophet teaches its , teachings and commands and wisdom.

Since the servant's job is to obey the master, especially if He is the master of all the rulers, then to consider His commands as a cause of happiness and contentment for oneself is the ascension of a servant.  The Importance and Significance of Worship: In Islam, the first emphasis is given to worship after the reformation of faith or belief. . Worship is a practical form of direct contact and relationship with Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty says: 201cAnd I have not created Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me.201d (Surah Al-Zariyat: 56). In another place, the Almighty says: 201cO people! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may save (from His punishment).201d (Surah Al-Baqarah:21).

The verse mentioned above gives a brief and comprehensive outline of the straight path, which is the soul of Islamic life. It is the lifeblood of Islamic society. The verse mentioned above states that every Muslim's breath, step, and deed should be for Allah Almighty's sake, not for the other and one's desire. This is the purpose of a Muslim's life.  The Requisites of Worship: We should obey all the commands of Allah Almighty and should act upon them. We must abstain from what He has made unlawful and act upon what He has made obligatory and compulsory with complete obedience. We should bring every aspect of life under the sphere of obedience to Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty says: 201cO Believers! Enter into Islam wholeheartedly.201d (Surah Al-Baqarah: 208).  Effects of Worship on Man's Practical Life: The Islamic System of worship develops feelings of love and sympathy in man for other human beings. Therefore, a Muslim loves other people. He loves and sympathizes with them and helps them in their sorrows. In the same way, these acts of worship also teach patience and forbearance. At the same time, they awake the spirit to sacrifice their interests for the sake  ' of Allah Almighty and the collective good.  Worship teaches man to live together collectively, so man learns to live together with other human beings and becomes a socialist.  Punctuality of worship eliminates bad habits like laziness, idleness and wastage of time.  The punctuality of prayer creates in man the qualities like observance of time, outward and inward purification, the obedience of a leader and collectivity. He abstains from evils and obscenities.

Shariah Term: Jihad in Islamic Shariah is to make every effort and endeavour for the sake of Allah Almighty, which is for the upliftment, protection and defence of the country and nation.

The Almighty says in the Holy Qur'an: 201cAnd for one who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains his soul from evil desire, then indeed Paradise only is his destination.201d (Surah al-Nazi'at: 40-41).

In some traditions, striving against one's soul is declared as the biggest Jihad (Jihad-e-Akbar).  2. Jihad to Eradicate Evils: When individual evils prevail commonly in any society, they go ahead and take the form of collective evils. Islam has named all these as evils (Munkaraat).  An Islamic society is based on the principles of mutual good and welfare. Therefore, Islam not only rejects every action that causes trouble in society but also commands believers to eradicate it. Islam emphasizes that the social order should be peaceful and organized in  all cases. It is possible only through the promotion of mutual tolerant \\  attitudes. Islam has pointed out the deeds which fall under evil. These deeds include theft, looting, lousy behaviour based on linguistic and national distinctions, perjury, abuse, bribery, adulteration, underweighting, foul rituals and deprivation of rights etc. In Islam, it is the responsibility of every single member of society to try to save him and others from evils through individual and collective efforts.

Allah Almighty says: 201cThey are those who have been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming, 2018Our Lord is Allah2019.201d (Surah Al-Hajj: 40)  The intense opposition and enmity of the infidels of Makkah \\  towards the Muslims can be guessed from this verse as well, 201cAnd they (infidels) will always fight you until they turn you away from your faith if they can.201d (Surah Al-Baraqah: 217)  Threat to the existence of the Islamic State: The pagans of Makkah did not bear the words of truth in Makkah. A state was founded in Medina on the same words of truth. Hence, the fear of the pagans increased that the power of Islam would become a permanent threat to them. So their sleep flew. They increased their evil efforts and began planning a war to remove the Islamic State. So Allah Almighty revealed these commands for the defence to Muslims. 201cAnd those who fight you, "}

Its recitation and listening are the sources of reward.  Its understanding, reflecting its verses, is the cause of the goodness of both worlds. While obedience to its teachings, preaching it to others  and conveying its message to the people who are deprived of its  blessings is a great virtue and the source of success in both worlds.  Revelation of the Holy Quran in the Arabic language: Allah says in the Holy Quran: o00e9x5 Malye rs agit; (Yusuf: 2). Translation: Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur2019an in order that you may understand.  The Holy Quran is Allah's book, which has been read for centuries  as it was read at the time of its revelation. The main reason is that it was revealed in the Arabic language and its unique narration style.  Unique style: The greatest virtue of the Holy Quran is that it is the word of Allah. It is unique in its style. It is very attractive and has great power to influence hearts. There is no contradiction in its themes and meanings, which is evidence of its veracity. Allah says: Translation: (al-Nisa: 27).  It is reported in a Hadith that the Holy Prophet sbstsal uesagleabide ss said: Translation: 201cThe superiority of the Holy Quran over the rest  of the speeches is like the superiority of Allah over the creature.201d | (Shu2019ab al-Iman, al-Baihaqi, Hadith No. 2208). As Allah has superiority over the whole of the universe, His words have superiority and glory over the universe.  It is a book free of any doubt: The Holy Quran has declared its glory in its beginning. It is stated: 201ca 59240) 4 (Surah al-Baqarah: 2). Translation: This is the Book(the Qur2019an), whereof there is no doubt. The Holy Quran is a complete code of life: The Holy Quran is the complete code of life for the physical, spiritual, religious, and worldly needs of all human beings.

Not to transgress means to use force where it is inevitable and to use it to the extent that it is needed.  The objectives of the armed Jihad:Besides defending and protecting the Islamic state, the Holy Qur'an has also described other objectives of armed Jihad. They are as follows:  A: Punishment for breaking the agreement: Islam places great emphasis on fulfilling the agreements. The divine instruction is: 201cAnd when you make an agreement with Allah, then fulfill it, and when you have sworn with a firm oath, do not break them, for you have made Allah your guarantor, and Allah knows what you do.201d (Surah Al-Nahal: 91)  Islam has commanded to fight against the nation that makes an agreement with the Islamic government not to wage war and has intentions of war behind that agreement. The Holy Qur'an, while  addressing The Holy Prophet dasaleal sal pesailcatids, said: 201cIf you find them in battle, then punish them in such a way that those who are  behind them (maybe warned). There is no doubt that Allah does not like the treacherous.201d (....... 36-38)  Although the background of the revelation of these verses is for a  / special occasion, its command is general. In other words, Islam has no concession to a treacherous nation. If a nation breaks an agreement and . tries to fight, Islam has ordered the Islamic government to fight against it.  B: Respect for humanity and helping the oppressed: Islam has the  most significant message of human dignity. The principles laid down for  humanity have been declared necessary for the Islamic government to  support and help the oppressed, to get rid of the oppressor's oppression.  In Surah Al-Nisa, Allah Almighty says: 201cAnd what is with you! You  do not fight in the way of Allah and for those oppressed men, women, and  _ children who cry out: Our Lord! Take us out of this land of oppressors! And appoint them for us a saviour on your behalf.201d (Surah Al-Nisa: 75).  1 > "}
{"class": "9th", "category": "Textbook", "subject": "Islamiat", "page_168": "This verse refers to those oppressed men, women and children 00a9  who were left in Makkah and were unable to migrate. The pagans were persecuting them to the extent that their life became intolerable. However, in this verse, the high goal of Jihad is stated that if human rights are being violated in any region of the world and that land is narrowed for them, so it is the duty of the Islamic government to help the oppressed Muslims as much as possible and save them from oppression.  C: Elimination of sedition and mischief: One of the main objectives of Islamic teachings is to establish peace, promote love and tolerance, and eliminate sedition and mischief.  Wherever in the world, if any government or group attacks the weak for its evil purposes and inflicts oppression, sedition and mischief endangering peace and tranquillity, the Holy Qur'an urges the Islamic State to wage war against them in order to refrain from such sedition and oppression. Allah Almighty says: 201cFight against them until there is no more persecution and (in the country) the religion will be entirely to Allah, if they stop persecuting you, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.201d (Surah al-Baqarah: 193).  In this verse, eradicating sedition and mischief on earth and creating an atmosphere of peace and harmony in the world is stated as the aim of Jihad.  Conditions of armed Jihad: Islam has laid down some conditions for 3  armed Jihad, these should be kept in view while doing Jihad, and they are as follows:  A: For the exaltation of the religion of Allah: The first condition of armed Jihad is that it should be only for the exaltation of the religion of Allah.  B: Declaration by the Islamic State: The second condition of armed Jihad is that the state should make a declaration of war. In Islam, only the state has the authority to declare war. Therefore, the declaration of an individual or a group or issuing a Fatwa has no value in Shariah for "}

C: Adequate availability of military power: The government should have adequate power and strength to fight the opposing force. The Holy Qur'an has emphasized to keep the Islamic state strong. He said: 201cPrepare (as much as possible) against them what you can of military power and cavalry to deter Allah2019s enemies and your enemies as well as other enemies you do not know but Allah knows them. And whatever you spend in the way of Allah will be paid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.201d (Sruah al-Anfaal: 60)  The meaning of this verse is that O' Muslims! You should always be ready with the equipment of war and a permanent army to take immediate action in case of need and fight the enemy to the fullest.  D: Methods of ignorance should not be used in war: The fight should be against those who are armed in battle and ready to fight. Women, children, the elderly, the wounded and civilians should not be attacked. The victims of the enemies should not be cut off their ears and noses, and the fields, houses and livestock should not be destroyed without any reason.  The difference between Jihad and fighting: The meaning of Jihad is to do utmost struggle to achieve a goal. Word Jihad is not a synonym  ' of war. The word \"Qi'tal\" (fighting) is used for war, while Jihad has a  broader meaning, which includes all kinds of struggle. Jihad for the  201d sake of Allah is that everything should be done only for the sake of  Allah in order to establish the religion of Allah on His land. "}
